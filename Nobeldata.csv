Effects of ischemia.,"Experimental myocardial ischemia produced in dogs by proximal left anterior descending coronary artery ligation is accompanied by relatively rapid (1 h) increases in the number of (-) [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites without changing their dissociation constants in ischemic left ventricular tissue. The changes, persist for at least 8 h and are accompanied by marked decreases in myocardial tissue ischemic region norepinephrine content. In contrast, in the same canine model 1 h of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery ligation did not result in a significant change in the number of [3H]quinuclidynl benzilate binding sites of their dissociation constants. However, the number of [3H]quinuclidynl benzilate binding sites (muscarinic cholinergic receptors) are 50--70% greater than (-) [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites (beta adrenergic receptors) in canine left ventricular tissue. Thus, the data suggest that proximal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 1 h significantly increases the number of beta adrenergic receptors in ischemic left ventricular tissue without changing the number of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Whether the ischemia-produced increase in cardiac beta-receptor content is causally related to increased cyclic AMP levels that develop in ischemic tissue and/or an etiologic factor in arrhythmias originating from ischemic myocardial tissue will have to be determined in additional studies.",1979,25,164,3,0,3,6,6,7,6,7,12,10,7

That Is the Question!†,"A series of secondary dialkylammonium ions (RCH2)2NH2+ have been prepared, and their binding properties toward the macrocyclic polyether dibenzo[24]crown-8 (DB24C8) evaluated. By using this information, a route to a kinetically stable rotaxane-like entitystabilized by noncovalent bonding interactions between the DB24C8 macroring and the ammonium centerwas established, in which the crown ether slips over a dialkylammonium ion's stopper groups (R). However, we have found that the kinetic stability of this rotaxane-like entity is extremely dependent on the nature of the solvent in which it is dissolved, suggesting that pseudorotaxanes lie in the fuzzy domain between two sets of extremes, wherein a beadlike macrocycle and a dumbbell-like component may either (1) exist as a rotaxane or (2) be completely disassociated from one another.",1998,0,207,1,1,8,10,5,8,5,14,1,4,5

Secreted forms of APP found in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid arise by proteolytic cleavage of APP within the beta/A4 amyloid domain, precluding the possibility of amyloidogenesis for that population of molecules. In the present study, we have demonstrated that treatment of PC12 cells with phorbol ester produces a severalfold increase in secretion of APP695, APP751, and APP770. This increase is augmented by simultaneous treatment with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. These data indicate that protein phosphorylation regulates intra-beta/A4 amyloid cleavage and APP secretion. These and other results suggest that APP molecules can normally follow either of two processing pathways: regulated secretion or proteolytic degradation unassociated with secretion.",1992,18,338,5,8,24,31,24,25,20,23,17,18,10

1d43b78866f04f8c61679fdb721c94890fb4c2c1,"Charge Formation, Recombination, and Sweep-Out Dynamics in Organic Solar Cells","This article presents a critical discussion of the various physical processes occurring in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on recent experimental results. The investigations span from photoexcitation to charge separation, recombination, and sweep-out to the electrodes. Exciton formation and relaxation in poly[N-9?-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) and poly-3(hexylthiophene) (P3HT) are discussed based on a fluorescence up-conversion study. The commonly accepted paradigm describing the conversion of incident photons into charge carriers in the BHJ material is re-examined in light of these femtosecond time-resolved measurements. Transient photoconductivity, time-delayed collection field, and time-delayed dual pulse experiments carried out on BHJ solar cells demonstrate the competition between carrier sweep-out by the internal field and the loss of photogenerated carriers by recombination. Finally, an emerging hypothesis is discussed: that bimolecular recombination accounts for the majority of recombination from short circuit to open circuit in optimized solar cells, and that bimolecular recombination is bias- and charge-density-dependent. The study of recombination loss processes in organic solar cells leads to insights into what must be accomplished to achieve the ideal solar cell.",2012,126,283,3,11,44,45,31,30,30,22,30,25,15

The orientation of the LDL receptor in the plasma membrane is unknown. In the current studies the sequence of amino acids at the NH2-terminus of the bovine adrenal LDL receptor was determined, and a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-16 was prepared. Antibodies against this peptide were raised in rabbits and were shown by immunoblotting analysis to react specifically with the bovine LDL receptor. The anti- receptor peptide antibodies also bound to the LDL receptor on the outer surface of the plasma membrane of intact human fibroblasts, as visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. Specificity of this binding reaction was confirmed by the observation that the anti-receptor peptide antibodies did not bind to mutant fibroblasts from a patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia that lack LDL receptors. These data demonstrate that the LDL receptor is oriented in the plasma membrane with its NH2-terminus facing the extracellular surface.",1983,33,54,2,0,3,4,9,3,4,2,2,1,3

Effects of Hybridization on Overlap and Gross AO Populations,"The effects of AO hybridization on gross AO and overlap populations for LCAO‐MO electron configurations are discussed in terms of some simple examples, using equations and graphs. The validity of ``gross AO populations'' as true measures of the population in various AOs is critically discussed. It is shown that the degree of hybridization in the AOs of an LCAO MO does not in general give the true amount of s or p character in the MO; this is given instead by the gross s or p population in the MO. Nevertheless, ``forced hybridization'' among the AOs, although not contributing to gross AO populations, leads to important negative contributions to overlap populations, hence to bond energies. For example, forced 2s—2p hybridization has the result that the total overlap population for two pairs of electrons occupying bonding σ LCAO MOs built from 2s and 2pσ AOs in a homopolar diatomic molecule is actually less than the sum of the overlap populations which one would have if one pair could be in an MO built from pure 2s AOs and the other in an MO built from pure 2pσ AOs. This sort of forced hybridization with resultant loss of bond strength may explain why double bonds seldom if ever consist of two σ bonds.",1955,5,592,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Alpha 1 receptors are those with a higher affinity for prazosin than for yohimbine; alpha 2 receptors have a higher affinity for yohimbine than for prazosin. Phentolamine does not discriminate between the two receptor subtypes present in rabbit uterus. The alpha receptor population of rabbit uterus was found to be 37% alpha 1 receptors and 63% alpha 2 receptors. The human platelet and rat liver alpha receptors were determined to be exclusively alpha 2 and alpha 1 , respectively. In the uterus, prazosin had a 8800 fold greater affinity for alpha 1 than alpha 2 receptors while yohimbine had a 510 fold greater affinity for alpha 2 than alpha 1 receptors. The use of [ 3 H] dihydroergocryptine displacement curves generated with selective alpha receptor antagonists coupled with subsequent computer modeling provides a precise and powerful method for quantifying the alpha receptor population of a tissue; this technique should be of value in studying the detailed regulation of alpha receptors in tissues which have both alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptors.",1979,18,241,0,0,31,34,35,33,17,11,13,16,12

The section of the condenser considered is bounded by two rays, enclosing an angle $\ensuremath{\Phi}$, from the common center of curvature, $O$, of the equipotential surfaces. It is shown that a group of particles, homogeneous in energy, leaving a point $P$ on a normal to one of these boundaries and entering the condenser along this normal as a diverging bundle, will be brought to a focus at a point $Q$ lying on the line $\mathrm{PO}$ extended, if the proper potential is applied to the condenser. This permits the whole condenser gap to be used as a focusing energy analyzer, or monochromator, of very large useful aperture. The velocity dispersion and reduced velocity dispersion are calculated for the most general case, and are found to take the same simple form as do the corresponding expressions for the limited homogeneous magnetic field spectrograph. The expressions for the reduced velocity dispersion are identical in the two cases. Compensation for edge effect is discussed.

 Abstract
 
 The gag-pol protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the precursor to the enzymes responsible for reverse transcription and integration, is expressed from two genes that lie in different translational reading frames by ribosomal frameshifting. Here, we localize the site of frameshifting and show that the frameshifting reaction is mediated by slippage of two adjacent tRNAs by a single nucleotide in the 5′ direction. The gag terminator, which immediately follows the frameshift site, is not required for frameshifting. Other suspected retroviral frameshift sites mediate frameshifting when placed at the end of RSV gag. Mutations in RSV pol also affect synthesis of the gag-pol protein in vitro. The effects of these mutations best correlate with the potential to form an RNA stem-loop structure adjacent to the frameshift site. A short sequence of RSV RNA, 147 nucleotides in length, containing the frameshift site and stem-loop structure, is sufficient to direct frameshifting in a novel genetic context.

The reaction was followed by means of video-LEED, work function and rate measurements. The titration experiments with the oxygen-saturated Pd(110) surface revealed a change in the reaction mechanism from a uniform reduction of the oxygen coverage at high temperature (T ≈ 500 K) to a hole-eating mechanism at low temperature (T < 400 K). High oxygen coverages were found to have an inhibiting effect on the rate of CO2 production. This effect, which presumably is associated with the formation of subsurface oxygen, can be attributed to a lowering of the CO residence time caused by a decrease in the adsorption energy of CO and to a reduction of the CO sticking coefficient. Under steady-state conditions this inhibiting effect leads to the appearance of a hysteresis in the high rate branch of the kinetics of catalytic CO oxidation upon cyclic variation of the CO pressure.",1993,19,26,0,2,2,2,2,1,3,1,3,0,1

Here we demonstrate that GRK2 is a microtubule-associated protein and identify tubulin as a novel GRK2 substrate. GRK2 is associated with microtubules purified from bovine brain, forms a complex with tubulin in cell extracts, and colocalizes with tubulin in living cells. Furthermore, an endogenous tubulin kinase activity that copurifies with microtubules has properties similar to GRK2 and is inhibited by anti-GRK2 monoclonal antibodies. Indeed, GRK2 phosphorylates tubulinin vitro with kinetic parameters very similar to those for phosphorylation of the agonist-occupied β2-adrenergic receptor, suggesting a functionally relevant role for this phosphorylation event. In a cellular environment, agonist occupancy of GPCRs, which leads to recruitment of GRK2 to the plasma membrane and its subsequent activation, promotes GRK2-tubulin complex formation and tubulin phosphorylation. These findings suggest a novel role for GRK2 as a GPCR signal transducer mediating the effects of GPCR activation on the cytoskeleton.",1998,85,162,2,4,18,13,8,7,12,6,6,6,8
a4ad628993ad860849666a8d81aff41ff144475a,Coagulation factor IXa: the relaxed conformation of Tyr99 blocks substrate binding.,"BACKGROUND
Among the S1 family of serine proteinases, the blood coagulation factor IXa (fIXa) is uniquely inefficient against synthetic peptide substrates. Mutagenesis studies show that a loop of residues at the S2-S4 substrate-binding cleft (the 99-loop) contributes to the low efficiency. The crystal structure of porcine fIXa in complex with the inhibitor D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone (PPACK) was unable to directly clarify the role of the 99-loop, as the doubly covalent inhibitor induced an active conformation of fIXa.


RESULTS
The crystal structure of a recombinant two-domain construct of human fIXa in complex with p-aminobenzamidine shows that the Tyr99 sidechain adopts an atypical conformation in the absence of substrate interactions. In this conformation, the hydroxyl group occupies the volume corresponding to the mainchain of a canonically bound substrate P2 residue. To accommodate substrate binding, Tyr99 must adopt a higher energy conformation that creates the S2 pocket and restricts the S4 pocket, as in fIXa-PPACK. The energy cost may contribute significantly to the poor K(M) values of fIXa for chromogenic substrates. In homologs, such as factor Xa and tissue plasminogen activator, the different conformation of the 99-loop leaves Tyr99 in low-energy conformations in both bound and unbound states.


CONCLUSIONS
Molecular recognition of substrates by fIXa seems to be determined by the action of the 99-loop on Tyr99. This is in contrast to other coagulation enzymes where, in general, the chemical nature of residue 99 determines molecular recognition in S2 and S3-S4. This dominant role on substrate interaction suggests that the 99-loop may be rearranged in the physiological fX activation complex of fIXa, fVIIIa, and fX.",1999,41,108,0,0,3,5,5,8,8,4,7,3,5

In fact, in a recent study (Chow, R. H., J. Klingauf, and E. Neher. 1994. Time course of Ca2+ concentration triggering exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91:12765-12769) Chow et al. concluded that the concentration of free calcium ([Ca2+]i) at a release site peaks at < 10 microM during short-step depolarizations, and then decays to baseline over tens of milliseconds. To check whether such a time course is consistent with diffusion theory, we modeled buffered diffusion in the vicinity of a Ca2+ channel pore. Peak [Ca2+]i and the slow decay were well simulated when release-ready granules were randomly distributed within a regular grid of Ca2+ channels with mean interchannel distances of 300-600 nm. For such large spacings, however, the initial rise in [Ca2+]i was underestimated, suggesting that a small fraction of the release-ready pool (approximately 10%) experiences much higher [Ca2+]i, and thus might be colocalized with Ca2+ channels. A model that accommodates these findings then correctly predicts many recent observations, including the result that single action potentials evoke near-synchronous transmitter release with low quantal yield, whereas trains of action potentials lead to desynchronized release, but with severalfold increased quantal yield. The simulations emphasize the role of Ca2+ not only in triggering, but also in modulating the secretory response: buffers are locally depleted by residual Ca2+ of a preceding stimulus, so that a second pulse leads to a larger peak [Ca2+]i at the fusion sites.",1997,30,305,29,6,16,25,35,15,7,13,11,8,20

In brain extracts, the immunoreactive substances were further separated according to molecular size by gel filtration. beta-Endorphin was found in the diencephalon but not in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and striatum. Enkephalin was found predominantly in the striatum and diencephalon. Attention is called to possible artifactual interference by myelin basic protein in the immunoassays for beta-endorphin in some regions of the brain. In the pituitary, enkephalin was mainly restricted to the pars intermedia-neurohypophysis. Neither adrenalectomy nor hypophysectomy significantly altered levels of beta-endorphin in brain extracts. Adrenalectomy increased the levels of beta-endorphin in adenohypophysis and pars intermedia-neurohypophysis; after adrenalectomy, enkephalin was also increased in the adenohypophysis but less so in the pars intermedia-neurohypophysis.

Place fields were smaller and sharper in proximal CA3 than in distal CA3 and CA2. The proximodistal shift was accompanied by a progressive loss in the ability of place cells to distinguish configurations of the same spatial environment, as well as a reduction in the extent to which place cells formed uncorrelated representations for different environments. The transition to similar representations was nonlinear, with the sharpest drop in distal CA3. These functional changes along the CA3-CA2 axis mirror gradients in gene expression and connectivity that partly override cytoarchitectonic boundaries between the subfields of the hippocampus.

Calcium-dependent LDCV exocytosis was reduced 10-fold in mouse chromaffin cells lacking Munc18-1, but the kinetic properties of the remaining release, including single fusion events, were not different from controls. Concomitantly, mutant cells displayed a 10-fold reduction in morphologically docked LDCVs.

We pay particular attention to the role played by surface dangling (non-hydrogen-bonding) OH groups. After optimizing six low index faces, we find that NAT(001) and (001) faces are thermodynamically the most stable. Only one surface site on the (001) face, with one nearby dangling OH group, exhibits a high affinity for HCl. At this binding site, adsorbed HCl forms a strong H...O hydrogen bond with an NO 3 - ion and a weaker Cl...H hydrogen bond with a nearby H 2 O molecule. The interaction energy and enthalpy at 190 K corrected for zero-point energies are 23 and 25 kJ/mol, respectively. The presence of one strong binding site per simulation cell, versus at least three previously reported on the (0001) face of ice Ih (Mantz, Y. A.; Geiger, F. M.; Molina, L. T.; Molina, M. J.; Trout, B. L. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 105, 7037), leads to a prediction of a lower HCl surface coverage on NAT than on ice, qualitatively consistent with experiments conducted on these surfaces. Additionally, we present kinetic and thermodynamic evidence that molecular HCl, adsorbed near one or two dangling OH groups, does not dissociate on NAT. By contrast, molecularly adsorbed HCI likely dissociates when interacting strongly with two dangling OH group on the ice Ih (0001) face as reported in previously published theoretical studies (Svanberg, M.; Pettersson, J.

Variation in domain structure and more subtle structural differences control their characteristic specificity profiles for substrates from among four distinct classes (Nagase, H., and Woessner, J. F. J. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 21491–21494). Exploitation of these differences may be decisive for the design of anticancer or other drugs, which should be highly selective for their particular MMP targets. Based on the 1.8-Å crystal structure of human neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) in complex with an active site-directed inhibitor (RO200-1770), we identify and describe new structural determinants for substrate and inhibitor recognition in addition to the primary substrate recognition sites. RO200-1770 induces a major rearrangement at a position relevant to substrate recognition near the MMP-8 active site (Ala206–Asn218). In stromelysin (MMP-3), competing stabilizing interactions at the analogous segment hinder a similar rearrangement, consistent with kinetic profiling of several MMPs. Despite the apparent dissimilarity of the inhibitors, the central 2-hydroxypyrimidine-4,6-dione (barbiturate) ring of the inhibitor RO200-1770 mimics the interactions of the hydroxamate-derived inhibitor batimastat (Grams, F., Reinemer, P., Powers, J. C., Kleine, T., Pieper, M., Tschesche, H., Huber, R., and Bode, W. (1995)Eur. J. Biochem. 228, 830–841) for binding to MMP-8. The two additional phenyl and piperidyl ring substituents of the inhibitor bind into the S1′ and S2′ pockets of MMP-8, respectively. The crystal lattice contains a hydrogen bond between the Oγgroup of Ser209 and Nδ 1 of His207 of a symmetry related molecule; this interaction suggests a model for recognition of hydroxyprolines present in physiological substrates. We also identify a collagenase-characteristic cis-peptide bond, Asn188–Tyr189, on a loop essential for collagenolytic activity. The sequence conservation pattern at this position marks this cis-peptide bond as a determinant for triple-helical collagen recognition and processing.",2001,53,106,2,0,4,6,7,7,8,8,6,4,8

The effect of ribosome “factors” (materials released from polysomes by 0.5 or 1.0 M KCl) on the translation of messenger RNA has been tested by injecting factors and mRNA into living frog oocytes. Factors were prepared from mammalian reticulocytes as well as from frog oocytes and were tested with Hb mRNA from mammalian reticulocytes. Injected oocytes were labelled with amino acids during incubation, and the effect of factors was judged from the ratio of labelled haemoglobin to labelled oocyte proteins synthesised by injected oocytes. 2. The factors released from reticulocyte ribosomes by KCl may contain up to 30 % of the total haemoglobin message activity of reticulocyte polysomes. When Hb mRNA was supplied at a low concentration so that its supply limited the rate of haemoglobin synthesis, reticulocyte factors had no effect on its translation. When Hb mRNA was supplied at a high enough concentration for some other component to limit the rate of haemoglobin synthesis, reticulocyte and oocyte factors altered the pattern of protein synthesis only slightly in favour of haemoglobin and oocyte proteins, respectively.",1972,7,8,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,1,0,2,0

If larger droplets are produced near the top of the cloud by the melting of snowflakes (Bergeron-Findeisen) they may grow to raindrop size by accretion due to coalescence with cloud droplets. A quantitative theory is developed for the efficiency of the accretion process considering the trajectories of the small droplets moving near the surface of the larger falling drop. Heavy rain consisting of large drops frequently forms in tropical clouds which lie wholly below the freezing level (‘warm’ clouds). Large summer cumulus clouds with tops above 23,000 ft, reaching above the freezing level (‘cool’ clouds), after seeding with dry ice have given heavy rain of large drops which reach the ground within fifteen to twenty mi...",1948,4,306,7,0,3,2,8,6,6,3,6,3,6

These mutants oligomerize when expressed in Escherichia coli. The dimer of a mutant with four glutamines now has been crystallized, and its structure has been solved by molecular replacement by using the wild-type monomer as a search model. The structure of each half of the dimer is found to be the same as that of the wild-type monomer, except around the glutamine insertion. It was proposed that the components of the oligomers are held together by hydrogen bonds between the main-chain and side-chain amides of the glutamine repeats. Instead, they appear to form by swapping domains on folding in E. coli, and the glutamine repeats connecting the components of the dimers are disordered.",1999,32,62,5,1,1,5,2,2,2,5,4,2,2

These strain 13 lymph node cells were then tested for their ability to be stimulated to proliferate by the addition of DNP-PLL.

CHIP28 is a 28-kD integral protein which was proposed to mediate transmembrane water movement in red cells and kidney (Preston, G. M., T. P. Carroll, W. B. Guggino, and P. Agre. 1992. Science [Wash. DC]. 256:385-387). To determine whether CHIP28 could account for renal epithelial water transport, we used specific polyclonal antibodies to quantitate and localize CHIP28 at cellular and subcellular levels in rat kidney using light and electron microscopy. CHIP28 comprised 3.8% of isolated proximal tubule brush border protein. Except for the first few cells of the S1 segment, CHIP28 was immunolocalized throughout the convoluted and straight proximal tubules where it was observed in the microvilli of the apical brush border and in basolateral membranes. Very little CHIP28 was detected in endocytic vesicles or other intracellular structures in proximal tubules. Uninterrupted, heavy immunostaining of CHIP28 was also observed over both apical and basolateral membranes of descending thin limbs, including both short and long loops of Henle. These nephron sites have constitutively high osmotic water permeabilities. CHIP28 was not detected in ascending thin limbs, thick ascending limbs, or distal tubules, which are highly impermeable to water. Moreover, CHIP28 was not detected in collecting duct epithelia, where water permeability is regulated by antidiuretic hormone. These determinations of abundance and structural organization provide evidence that the CHIP28 water channel is the predominant pathway for constitutive transepithelial water transport in the proximal tubule and descending limb of Henle's loop.",1993,53,503,16,7,23,32,21,20,34,28,33,30,26

Although mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can produce functional gametes in vivo, it is still unclear whether or not they have the ability to produce presumptive germ cells in vitro. Here, we show that mouse iPS cells derived from adult hepatocytes were able to differentiate into presumptive germ cells marked by mouse vasa homolog (Mvh) expression in feeder‐free or suspension cultures. Embryoid body (EB) formation from iPS cells also induced the formation of round‐shaped cells resembling immature oocytes. Mvh+ cells formed clumps by co‐aggregation with differentiation‐supporting cells, and increased expression of germ cell markers was detected in these cell aggregates. Differentiation culture of presumptive germ cells from iPS cells could provide a conventional system for facilitating our understanding of the mechanisms underlying direct reprogramming and germline competency.

For certain ions the hydration water of which is sufficiently nonlabile (lifetime for exchange >10—4 sec), it is possible to display the hydration water as a separate NMR peak when the solvent peak is shifted by addition of a paramagnetic ion. A method is suggested for determining the hydration number of such cations by measuring the change in the water available to interact with the paramagnetic ions due to water retained in the hydration sphere of the cations.

Macrophages from Heedless homozygotes signaled by the MyD88-dependent pathway in response to rough lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipid A, but not in response to smooth LPS. In addition, the Heedless mutation prevented TRAM-TRIF–dependent signaling in response to all LPS chemotypes. Heedless also abolished macrophage responses to vesicular stomatitis virus and substantially inhibited responses to specific ligands for the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-TLR6 heterodimer. The Heedless phenotype was positionally ascribed to a premature stop codon in Cd14. Our data suggest that the TLR4–MD-2 complex distinguishes LPS chemotypes, but CD14 nullifies this distinction. Thus, the TLR4–MD-2 complex receptor can function in two separate modes: one in which full signaling occurs and one limited to MyD88-dependent signaling.",2005,28,652,49,6,47,57,61,57,58,46,40,46,33

b454816462b0b06949df6766b77949be66d5d046,Biopolymer synthesis on solid supports,"Abstract The concept of solid phase synthesis began as a new approach to the preparation of peptides, but has been extended to the synthesis of polynucleotides, polysaccharides, polyamides and a variety of other classes of compounds. The solid support simplifies and accelerates the synthetic process, aids the separation of reagents and by-products, and reduces problems of insolubility of intermediates. The synthesis may involve a stepwise addition of monomer units or the condensation of preformed oligomer fragments. Large numbers of peptides and several small proteins have been synthesized by the solid phase method. To facilitate the synthesis We have developed a new, more acid-stable attachment of the peptide to the polystyrene support, in which the chain is anchored through a hydroxymethylphenylacetamidomethyl group. Alternatively, the peptide chain can be anchored through a more labile alkoxybenzyl ester linkage, if the very acid-sensitive Bpoc group is used for Nα-protection. The ideal design for a multi-step synthesis will depend on a combination of protecting groups that are removable by completely independent reaction mechanisms. Such a system is called orthogonal . A new amino protecting group, the dithiasuccinoyl (Dts) group, has been designed for that purpose. It is removed by reduction, but is stable to acids and photolysis and can be used in conjunction with these two orthogonal modes of deprotection. The synthesis of biopolymers on solid supports was illustrated by studies of the role of arginine in the neurotoxin, apamin, and of the substrate specificity of a histone deacetylase and by a recent synthesis of crystalline glucagon.",1978,23,10,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Here we report that 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotides can act as irreversible, stoichiometric inhibitors of small RNA function. We show that a 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide complementary to an siRNA can block mRNA cleavage in Drosophila embryo lysates and HeLa cell S100 extracts and in cultured human HeLa cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans, injection of the 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide complementary to the miRNA let-7 can induce a let-7 loss-of-function phenocopy. Using an immobilized 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide, we show that the C. elegans Argonaute proteins ALG-1 and ALG-2, which were previously implicated in let-7 function through genetic studies, are constituents of a let-7-containing protein–RNA complex. Thus, we demonstrate that 2′-O-methyl RNA oligonucleotides can provide an efficient and straightforward way to block small RNA function in vivo and furthermore can be used to identify small RNA-associated proteins that mediate RNA silencing pathways.",2004,117,472,22,12,28,29,46,33,35,35,30,46,33

We define a class ${A}_{n}$ of functions of $n$ real variables, whose asymptotic behavior may be specified in a certain manner by means of certain ""asymptotic coefficients."" The Feynman integrands of perturbation theory (with energies taken imaginary) belong to such classes. We then prove that if certain conditions on the asymptotic coefficients are satisfied then an integral over $k$ of the variables converges, and belongs to the class ${A}_{n\ensuremath{-}k}$ with new asymptotic coefficients simply related to the old ones. When applied to perturbation theory this theorem validates the renormalization procedure of Dyson and Salam, proving that the renormalized integrals actually do always converge, and provides a simple rule for calculating the asymptotic behavior of any Green's function to any order of perturbation theory.",1960,0,431,7,0,0,0,1,0,2,2,2,5,6

Using goat antisera prepared toward a conformationally disordered nuclease fragment (99–149), antibodies specific for the disordered form of the helix-rich sequence 99 to 126, anti-(99–126) R , were isolated by sequential immunoabsorption. Anti-(99–126) R forms soluble 7 S complexes with fragment (99–149), but this interaction may be inhibited by a large excess of nuclease. By using fragment (99–149) preferentially carbamylated at the α-amino terminus with KN 14 CO and rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin to distinguish between antibody-bound and free fragment (99–149), an assay for the quantitation of the degree of inhibition of anti-(99–126) R .

Using a formal analysis based on the hypothesis that nuclease is in a conformational equilibrium between a folded and unfolded form and that anti-(99–126) R binds effectively only to the unfolded form, the K conf of nuclease was estimated to be 2900.

It has been demonstrated that estrogen modulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression through the estrogen receptor in endothelial cells. However, little is known about the relationship between ERR alpha 1 and eNOS. In this study, we show that ERR alpha 1 activates the estrogen response element (ERE) and eNOS promoter-dependent luciferase activity in COS-7 cells and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. The endogenous ligand for ERR alpha 1 has not been identified, but we show that these actions are dependent on serum constituents because ERR alpha 1 fails to stimulate eNOS promoter-dependent luciferase activity in charcoal-treated serum. Furthermore, through the use of truncated eNOS promoter luciferase constructs, we demonstrate that the activation of eNOS transcription by ERR alpha 1 is mediated via three regions: base pairs -1001 to -743, base pairs -743 to -265, and downstream from base pair -265 on the eNOS promoter. In addition, ERR alpha 1 up-regulates eNOS mRNA and protein expression and stimulates eNOS activity in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. These results suggest that ERR alpha 1 has a potential role in the regulation of eNOS expression and may stimulate NO production by endothelial cells, which may in turn result in a protective effect against atherosclerosis.",2003,0,50,1,0,1,5,1,1,3,1,1,7,3

Unfortunately, RNAi does not inhibit all genes. We show that loss of function of a putative RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) of C. elegans, RRF-3, results in a substantial enhancement of sensitivity to RNAi in diverse tissues. This is particularly striking in the nervous system; neurons that are generally refractory to RNAi in a wild-type genetic background can respond effectively to interference in an rrf-3 mutant background. These data provide the first indication of physiological negative modulation of the RNAi response and implicate an RdRP-related factor in this effect. The rrf-3 strain can be useful to study genes that, in wild-type, do not show a phenotype after RNAi, and it is probably the strain of choice for genome-wide RNAi screens.",2002,18,604,47,1,27,42,54,64,40,42,31,38,29

However, the signals are intrinsically weak and call for enhancement techniques. Here, we demonstrate Purcell enhancement of Raman scattering in a tunable high-finesse microcavity, and utilize it for molecular diagnostics by combined Raman and absorption imaging. Studying individual single-wall carbon nanotubes, we identify crucial structural parameters such as nanotube radius, electronic structure and extinction cross-section. We observe a 320-times enhanced Raman scattering spectral density and an effective Purcell factor of 6.2, together with a collection efficiency of 60%. Potential for significantly higher enhancement, quantitative signals, inherent spectral filtering and absence of intrinsic background in cavity-vacuum stimulated Raman scattering render the technique a promising tool for molecular imaging. Furthermore, cavity-enhanced Raman transitions involving localized excitons could potentially be used for gaining quantum control over nanomechanical motion and open a route for molecular cavity optomechanics.",2015,47,52,0,0,5,7,14,13,7,5,0,0,0
51a9ed2d7133f2c76b36ee5d6dc62c5df3c54e95,A double perfusion‐pump,"THE heart-lung preparation of Starling and his co-workers has provided a means, extensively used, of studying the functions of the mammalian heart when working against an artificial and adjustable peripheral resistance, which replaces the natural resistance of the systemic vascular system. Many schemes have been devised and used, on the other hand, in which the blood has been perfused through the living vessels of an organ or part of the body by use of an artificial pump. Our original object in devising the pump here described was to produce an adjustable mechanism which could be used to replace the heart, and to carry on both major and minor circulations of the whole body. This would obviously require two synchronously working pumps. Since the two pumps would be working against widely different resistances it was further important that their throws should be rapidly and independently adjustable while running, so as to maintain such equality of output on the two sides as would prevent accumulation of blood on one side of the system, with deleterious back-pressure on the capillaries of the lungs or of the rest of the body, as the case might be. If the pumps and tubular connections were perfectly non-distensible, it should, theoretically, be possible to dispense with such adjustment; the two pumps being set to deliver equal amounts per stroke, they should continue to do this whatever changes occurred in the relation of the pressures they had to overcome. In practice, however, it would be very difficult to make a system of such ideal rigidity. The apparatus which we designed, in which diaphragmpumps were used, certainly would not have it. The arrangement was accordingly devised which enabled the throw of either pump lever to be increased or decreased quickly and adjusted with delicacy. Emb 1 ey and Martin (This Journal, 32. p. 147. 1905) used two rubber bulbsyringes, compressed by adjustable rotating cams, for a similar purpose. Our apparatus should give greater rapidity and precision of control, but the principle is the same.",1928,0,74,1,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,3

An electron-rich macrocyclic polyether containing two TTF units of different constitutions, namely 4,4'-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrathiafulvalene (OTTFO) and 4,4'-bisthiotetrathiafulvalene (STTFS), has been synthesized. On two-electron oxidation, a hetero radical dimer is formed between OTTFO(•+) and STTFS(•+). The redox behavior of the macrocyclic polyether has been investigated by electrochemical techniques and UV-vis and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. The [2]catenane in which the macrocyclic polyether is mechanically interlocked with the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT(4+)) ring has also been prepared using template-directed protocols. In the case of the [2]catenane, the formation of the TTF hetero radical dimer is prevented sterically by the CBPQT(4+) ring. After a one-electron oxidation, a 70:30 ratio of OTTFO(•+) to STTFS(•+) is present at equilibrium, and, as a result, two translational isomers of the [2]catenane associated with these electronically different isomeric states transpire. EPR titration spectroscopy and simulations reveal that the radical states of the two constitutionally different TTF units in the [2]catenane still experience long-range electronic intramolecular coupling interactions, despite the presence of the CBPQT(4+) ring, when one or both of them are oxidized to the radical cationic state. These findings in the case of both the free macrocyclic polyether and the [2]catenane have led to a deeper fundamental understanding of the mechanism of radical cation dimer formation between constitutionally different TTF units.",2012,99,31,0,0,0,8,8,4,2,2,3,3,1
69517b47eec9f90978cb36bcc6ef0df5bbcaf2f3,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for I region determinants do not require interactions with H-2K or D gene products,"Gene products coded for by the major hisocompatibility complex (MHC) can serve as target antigens for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (1). A variety of test systems are available which have yielded information consistently reinforcing the importance of this complex of genes in the generation and effector phases of the cytotoxic immune response. Originally, it was shown that allogeneically-induced CTL had specificity primarily for the products of the K and D loci of the mouse H-2 complex (2). More recently this has also been found to be the case for xenogeneic immunizations (3,4). Additional examples of T cell-mediated lysis have been reported involving viral-infected or chemically- modified syngeneic stimulating and target cells in which homology at H-2K or H-2D was required between the responding and target cells for appreciable lysis to occur (5-7). Moreover, CTL specific for minor histocompatability antigens are able to lyse only target cells bearing these membrane antigens and sharing a common H-2K or H2-D gene product with the effector (8,9). Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the requirement for H-2 identity between effector and targets in these systems. CTL may recognize new antigenic determinants created by the interaction of the modifier with syngeneic K and D gene products. Alternately, a dual recognition system my exist, requiring an antigen-specific receptor as well as a second receptor with specificity for homologous H-2K or H-2D determinants (5). Neither model can be excluded at this time. The I region also contains genes coding for histocompatibility loci since animals differing at the I-A or I-C regions of the H-2 complex reject skin grafts (10-12), though less rapidly than mice differing at the H-2K or H-2D regions, Also CTL can be generated to I region determinants but less efficiently than CTL specific for H-2K or H-2D gene products (12-14). The question can therefore be raised, whether the I region minor histocompatibility loci function independently from the H-2K or H-2D loci or whether I region-specific cytolysis requires the participation of H-2K or H-2D gene products of the target cell. This communication illustrates the generation of CTL showing specificity for I region determinants in primary mixed lymphocyte cultures. Further, we demonstrate by genetic analysis and byt eh use of speficit alloantisera that CTL directed to Ia determinants (a) do not see these antigens as modifications of H-2K or H-2D gene products but as independent gene products coded for by the I region, and (b) they do not require interaction with target cells bearing the same H-2K or H-2D gene product as the effect CTL.",1977,18,50,0,2,10,5,4,3,2,3,1,1,1

Seven genes controlling nuclear division.,"Temperature-sensitive mutations in seven genes (cdc 2, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, and 15) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae confer a defect in nuclear division. Following a shift from the permissive to the restrictive temperature, asynchronous populations of these mutant cells accumulate uniformly in nuclear division. Depending upon the particular gene defect, mutants appear to terminate development at an early stage of nuclear division (cdc 2), at a medial stage (cdc 6, 7, 9, 13), or at a late stage (cdc 14, 15). Experiments employing temperature shifts, time-lapse photomicroscopy, and synchronous cultures permitted a determination of the time in the cell cycle at which each of the thermolabile gene products completes its function at the permissive temperature (the execution point) for the ensuing nuclear division. These studies reveal a program of gene activity required for nuclear division that commences at the beginning of the cell cycle. Subsequent to the block in nuclear division the mutant strains do not undergo cell separation or bud initiation. Apparently, nuclear division is normally a prerequisite for the latter two processes.",1971,6,219,7,1,0,10,9,3,5,3,5,3,3

The resulting metal distribution (decoration pattern) can be mapped by electron microscopy in conjunction with image processing. We have applied this technique to freeze-etched crystals of the lumazine synthase-riboflavin synthase complex and its derivative obtained by binding of the heteropolytungstate (NaP5W30O110)(NH4)14.31 H2O. The decoration pattern of the free protein and its heteropolytungstate derivative showed marked differences. The correlation of these data with the X-ray structure of the protein showed an increased affinity of both gold and silver to the location of heteropolytungstate. Decoration sites can, but do not need to, be close to the protein surface. Actually, two of the observed decoration sites are located on a layer of ice as thick as 20 A, which apparently transmits underlying topochemical features. Preferential affinity of a site to a given metal must be seen as a property that depends on specific interaction with the decorating material but also on the differential affinities in adjacent areas.",1991,17,22,0,0,3,2,0,2,2,1,1,0,1

In sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts SREBPs from ER to Golgi for proteolytic processing, thereby allowing SREBPs to stimulate cholesterol synthesis. Sterols induce binding of SCAP to INSIG-1, as determined by blue native-PAGE, and this is correlated with the inhibition of SCAP exit from the ER. Overexpression of INSIG-1 increases the sensitivity of cells to sterol-mediated inhibition of SREBP processing. Mutant SCAP(Y298C) fails to bind INSIG-1 and is resistant to sterol-mediated inhibition of ER exit. By facilitating sterol-dependent ER retention of SCAP, INSIG-1 plays a central role in cholesterol homeostasis.",2002,32,889,66,6,35,52,50,52,45,41,55,37,53

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a recently discovered isoform of cyclooxygenase that is inducible by various types of inflammatory stimuli. Although this enzyme is considered to play a major role in inflammation processes by catalyzing the production of prostaglandins, the precise location, distribution, and regulation of prostaglandin synthesis remains unclear in several tissues. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, we investigated the induction of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expression after systemic administration of a pyrogen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in kidney and adrenal gland in the rat. The COX-2 mRNA signals dramatically increased 1 h after LPS treatment in the kidney outer medulla and adrenal cortex, where almost no or little expression was observed in nontreated animals, and returned to control levels within 24 h. COX-2 mRNA levels increased in the kidney inner medulla 6 h after treatment. There was also a significant increase in mRNA levels in the kidney cortex and adrenal medulla. On the other hand, COX-1 mRNA levels did not show any detectable changes except in the kidney inner medulla, where a significant downregulation of mRNA expression was observed after LPS treatment. Light and electron immunocytochemistry using COX-2 antibodies showed that strong COX-2 immunoreactivity was localized to certain cortical cells of the thick ascending limb of Henle. In addition, based on double-staining with antiserum to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) four further cell populations could be identified in kidney cortex, including weakly COX-2-positive, NOS-positive macula densa cells. After LPS treatment, changes in COX-2 immunoreactivity could be observed in interstitial cells in the kidney medulla and in inner cortical cells in the adrenal gland. These results show that COX-2 is a highly induced enzyme that can be upregulated in specific cell populations in kidney and adrenal gland in response to inflammation, leading to the elevated levels of prostaglandins seen during fever. In contrast COX-1 mRNA levels remained unchanged in this experimental situation, except for a decrease in kidney inner medulla.",2001,41,50,3,0,4,7,6,2,4,4,3,4,1

Observations of 900 sources enabled the feature to be tracked for 20 days as it approached and passed over the Earth, and its 3-dimensional structure was determined by comparing the data with theoretical maps computed for simple models. The main features of the disturbance, including both its shape and development with radial distance, could be explained by a sector of enhanced density followed by a wider sector of below-average density, in accordance with the structure usually associated with a high-speed solar wind stream. Our observations and deductions are in broad agreement with spacecraft measurements of the solar plasma near Earth, although the high-speed flow was less prominent than expected. This may have been due, in part, to the location of the main disturbance above the ecliptic but our observations indicated significant temporal evolution and it is likely that the speed of the stream was decreasing as it passed the Earth.",1984,14,29,0,0,1,6,3,2,1,1,2,0,1

The PAA-conjugated liposomes were internalized and digested in an acidic compartment at a much faster rate than the unmodified phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes. After incubation for 18 h, an over 5-fold increase in the uptake of PC liposomes was obtained by PAA conjugation. Subsequently, part of the aqueous phase of the internalized liposomes was exocytosed. Recognition of PAA by the macrophages seems to be responsible for the enhanced uptake of PAA-conjugated liposomes. Cross-competition experiments showed that PAA-conjugated liposomes inhibited the uptake of acetylated-low density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL) by the macrophages and vice versa. The uptake of PAA-conjugated liposomes was also inhibited by dextran sulfate and maleylated-bovine serum albumin (maleyl-BSA), which are also known to bind to scavenger receptors. Poly(C) and BSA, which are not ligands for the scavenger receptor, competed poorly with the uptake of PAA-conjugated liposomes. Enhanced uptake of PAA-conjugated liposomes by CHO cells with low scavenger receptor expression was not observed. Unexpectedly, LDL, which is not a ligand for scavenger receptor, also partially inhibited the uptake of PAA-conjugated liposomes. The interaction of PAA-conjugated liposomes with macrophages is complex, and the endocytosis of PAA-conjugated liposomes most likely involves multiple receptors and/or pathways. The data obtained suggest that the high affinity binding of PAA-conjugated liposomes to macrophages may be due to recognition of the negative charges of PAA by cell surface receptors, including the scavenger receptor.",1996,21,49,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,2

V: Suppression of MIF production by lymphokine-activated macrophages.,"The systemic injection of high doses of antigen into a previously immunized animal results in a state of transient anergy with respect to cell-mediated immune reactions. This phenomenon is known as desensitization. We have previously shown that desensitization is a multistage process. The initial 24-hr period is characterized by excessive lymphokine production with a failure to express delayed hypersensitivity reactions due to abolition of local chemotactic gradients. Subsequent stages of desensitization involve failure of lymphokine production in vivo. The results presented here demonstrate that lymphocytes obtained from immunized and desensitized animals later than 24 hr after desensitization are markedly suppressed in their ability to produce MIF. In addition, it was found that lymphokine-activated macrophages can suppress in vitro MIF production by lymphocytes from immune, nondesensitized animals. In vitro and in vivo activation of macrophages were equally effective. Thus, it is likely that at least one mechanism for the inhibition of lymphokine production in the post-24-hr period of desensitization, involves activation of a population of suppressor macrophages by lymphokines produced during the initial 24-hr period.",1985,25,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

In this study, we investigated the differential role of neurons and astrocytes in the regulation of tPA/PAI-1 activity in ischemic brain. The activity of tPA peaked transiently and then decreased in cortex and striatum along with delayed induction of PAI-1 in the inflammatory stage after MCAO/reperfusion injury. In cultured primary cells, glutamate stimulation increased tPA activity in neurons but not in other cells such as microglia and astrocytes. With LPS stimulation, a model of neuroinflammatory insults, robust PAI-1 induction was observed in astrocytes but not in neurons and microglia. The upregulation of PAI-1 by LPS in astrocytes was also verified by RT-PCR analysis as well as PAI-1 promoter reporter assay. Lastly, we checked the effects of hypoxia on tPA/PAI-1 activity. Hypoxia increased tPA release from neurons without effects on microglia, while the activity of tPA in astrocyte was decreased consistent with increased PAI-1 activity in astrocyte. Taken together, the results from the present study suggest that neurons are the major source of tPA and that the glutamate-induced stimulated release is mainly governed by neurons in the acute phase. In contrast, the massive up-regulation of PAI-1 in astrocytes during subchronic and chronic inflammatory conditions, leads to decreased tPA activity in the later stages of MCAO. Differential regulation of tPA and PAI-1 in neurons, astrocytes and microglia suggest more attention is required to understand the role of local tPA activity in the vicinity of individual cell types.",2011,77,27,0,1,3,6,4,3,3,1,4,1,0

e8dcd259ec7c070bd4cec2c5683f42165d762a66,A reciprocal space approach to the orbitals of truncated crystals,"Large clusters and small crystallites are a form of matter intermediate between discrete molecules and infinite solids. At the same time as they are structurally intriguing, they are difficult to treat by using conventional orbital methods. A linear combination of crystal orbitals (LCCO) method is described for calculating the orbitals of large, finite systems such as clusters, crystallites, or thin films from a band calculation on the corresponding infinite solid. Our analysis breaks the problem into two parts: (1) choosing k points where orbitals of the solid resemble cluster MOs and (2) performing a perturbation calculation to include the effects of truncating the crystal and of adding the end atoms omitted from the band calculation. The reciprocal space of the finite crystal and its relation to the reciprocal lattice of the infinite solid provide a fundamental connection between cluster M O s and crystal orbitals of the solid. Wannier functions localized within a large unit cell corresponding to the cluster make the connection explicit and guide the choice of k points for the band calculation. In the final step, the perturbation calculation is accomplished by using a matrix diagonalization algorithm introduced by Davidson to solve the CI problem for small molecules. The LCCO method is illustrated for hydrocarbon polyenes and transition-metal chains related to [Rh(CN(CHz),NC)2]4C15+. Both the delocalized levels and the orbitals localized near the edges of the clusters are reliably reproduced. For the Rh4 chain we find that the central Rh-Rh bond can be shortened by making terminal ligands more electronegative or lengthened by less electronegative capping groups. Preferred cluster electron counts can be found by locating low densities of states in the corresponding solid. For the Rh, oligomers, they appear within the steep z2 band of the infinite polymer-at electron counts near d7-d8. The HOMO for long Rh, oligomers with d7-d8 electron counts will therefore have metal z2 character and fall in the energy range spanned by the z2 band of the infinite polymer. Although the method is illustrated with extended Huckel calculations for large clusters, the LCCO approach is general and can be used with any orbital method. The approach is also valid for other systems perturbed from perfect translational symmetry, such as surfaces, interfaces, and defects. The study of unusual materials with novel properties represents a strong and growing current in modern chemistry. Witness, for example, the discovery of heavy fermion superconductors,* organic ferromagnet^,^ and high T, oxide superconductors> Excitement over these and other recent advances has increased the trickle of new solid-state compounds to a flood. And traditional solid-state chemists are not alone in their search for intriguing new materials. Molecular chemists have been swept up in this torrent of activity as they seek to make clusters whose structures and properties approach those of bulk solids5 Indeed, the study of large clusters and small crystallites represents a bridge between molecular and solid-state chemistry. While molecular chemists synthesize transition-metal clusters resembling bulk metals and seek to understand them in molecular term~,~f' their solid-state counterparts try to understand the properties of small crystallites using concepts familiar from studies of extended solids.' Still other chemists find molecular clusters in solid-state compounds.s All of these workers-the molecular and the solid-state chemist, as well as the surface scientist who appeals to the surface-cluster analogy and organometallic chemistry to explain surface reactivity9--share a common desire to bridge solid-state and molecular chemistry. The systems under study differ from the bulk solid as they lack translational symmetry: molecules adsorb on crystals interrupted by a surface; clusters and crystallites represent solids bounded by several surfaces. Our interest, spurred by a question from Boon Teo regarding the possibility of deriving molecular orbitals for large clusters,I0 rests in a theoretical description of chemical bonding in systems perturbed from perfect translational symmetry. Some examples are the raft-like clusters such as Os6(CO) 17(P(OMe)& or Cu,Fe,(CO) 163-, built from pieces of a two-dimensional, close-packed hexagonal net;"" rhodium and platinum carbonyl clusters resembling pieces of hcp or fcc metals;I2 chains of face-sharing octahedra found in the Chevrel phases;sg or the metal-metal bonded oligomers based on the RhZ(LJ4& dimer.13 The clusters, or pieces-of-a-solid, mentioned above are fascinating in that they present us with a state of matter intermediate Current address: Department of Chemistry, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204-5641. 8 Permanent address: Quantum Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Warsaw, Pasteura 1, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland. 0002-7863/88/ 1510-7302%01.50/0 between the discrete molecule and the (almost) infinite solid.

Science, this issue p. 528 An electron cryomicroscopy structure gives insight into how mitoribosomes have evolved for species-specific function. Mitochondria have specialized ribosomes (mitoribosomes) dedicated to the expression of the genetic information encoded by their genomes. Here, using electron cryomicroscopy, we have determined the structure of the 75-component yeast mitoribosome to an overall resolution of 3.3 angstroms. The mitoribosomal small subunit has been built de novo and includes 15S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 34 proteins, including 14 without homologs in the evolutionarily related bacterial ribosome. Yeast-specific rRNA and protein elements, including the acquisition of a putatively active enzyme, give the mitoribosome a distinct architecture compared to the mammalian mitoribosome. At an expanded messenger RNA channel exit, there is a binding platform for translational activators that regulate translation in yeast but not mammalian mitochondria.

We have used paired whole‐cell voltage recordings from olfactory bulb slices to compare the functional connectivity of mitral cells to the known anatomy of the mitral cell network. Both inhibitory and excitatory coupling were observed between pairs of mitral cells. Inhibitory coupling was seen as an increased frequency of small, asynchronous GABAergic IPSPs following APs in the presynaptic cell. Excitatory coupling was short in latency, beginning about 1.3 ms after the presynaptic AP and was mediated by both NMDA and AMPA receptors. Mitral cell pairs were coupled by excitation if and only if their apical dendrites terminated in the same glomerulus. The excitatory coupling between mitral cells resembles conventional fast synaptic transmission in its time course, amplitude and latency, despite the absence of evidence for anatomically defined synapses between mitral cells.",2002,53,218,23,3,8,11,21,22,15,18,11,13,6

The cost-effectiveness of beta-blocker use in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) has never been elucidated in a Japanese study.


METHODS AND RESULTS
A Markov model for outpatients with CHF was constructed to simulate remaining life expectancy and expected medical costs for each patient. Each patient was assumed that they received either carvedilol in addition to conventional therapies (ie, digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or conventional therapies alone. Analyses were conducted both for each patient's remaining lifetime and for a period of 5 years. Analyses were performed from the perspective of Japanese healthcare insurance. Analysis for treatment over the course of each patient's expected life span with carvedilol plus conventional therapies versus conventional therapies alone yielded expected medical costs of 3.5 million yen and 5.5 million yen respectively, and a life expectancy of 121 months and 88 months, respectively. The analysis of a 5-year period yielded 1.4 million yen and 2.8 million yen in expected medical costs and 49 and 45 months life expectancy, respectively, for carvedilol versus conventional therapy.

In relatively harsher preparation conditions a ruthenium complex composed of one phenanthroline and two bis-thioethers is formed as a result of a scrambling reaction. When a bis-thioether chelate incorporated in a macrocycle also including a 6,6′-disubstituted-2,2′-bipyridine unit is used, 1 H NMR study shows that an exo S-bonded ruthenium(II) complex is obtained. In presence of chloride anions a photosubstitution reaction of the bis-thioether chelate takes place selectively and efficiently.",2007,43,18,0,1,2,0,0,2,0,1,3,1,3
1ac13cfbad018c68bc5a2456c467a06361c0c725,Expression of the blue-light receptor cryptochrome in the human retina.,"PURPOSE
To analyze the patterns of expression of the cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2, in the human retina and to correlate expression of these putative blue-light receptors with nonvisual photoreceptor localization.


METHODS
CRY1 and CRY2 mRNA expression was analyzed in 4-mm diameter punches of macula and midperipheral human retina by quantitative RT-PCR. CRY2 protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in cross sections of human retina, and its subcellular localization was determined by immunoblot analysis of fractionated human retinal extracts.


RESULTS
CRY2 mRNA was 11 times more abundant than CRY1 throughout adult human retina. CRY2 immunoreactivity was detected in most cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and in a subset of cells in the inner nuclear layer (INL) in both the macula and periphery. Immunoperoxidase staining further revealed that CRY2 was localized throughout the cytoplasm of cells in the GCL as well as within nuclei. This intracellular localization of CRY2 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of fractionated human retinal extracts.


CONCLUSIONS
Photopigments governing circadian photoreception have been localized to the inner retina. The relative abundance of CRY2 transcripts, coupled with CRY2 localization to the inner retina, supports a photoreceptive role for CRY2 in human retina. Furthermore, the discovery that CRY2 is also localized within the cytoplasm of some cells in the GCL, suggests it may perform a function separate from its known nuclear role in the transcriptional feedback loop underlying the molecular circadian clock.",2003,36,54,2,0,4,7,4,5,2,2,3,2,3

Granulosa cells were aspirated 3\p=n-\4h before the expected time of ovulation from 10 follicles of 4 patients treated with gonadotrophins : 4 of the follicles were immediately preovulatory. The granulosa cells were cultured for 10 h with 17\g=a\-hydroxypregnenolone or dehydroepiandrosterone and samples of medium removed at 3 and 10 h were assayed for 6 steroids. Granulosa cells were unable to synthesize androgens from endogenous substrate or undertake conversions via the \g=D\5 pathway, but cells from all follicles were capable of aromatizing exogenous androgens to oestrogens although this capability was reduced in cells from follicles beginning to luteinize. Granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles synthesized more progesterone from endogenous substrate than cells from follicles which had not begun to luteinize. The results provide further support for the two-cell theory of oestrogen biosynthesis whereby granulosa cells aromatize androgens which are synthesized by the thecal cells in vivo.",1978,25,17,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Of the six synthetic stereoisomers evaluated, only the 5S,12R,6,14-cis,8,10-trans compound had chemotactic potency for human neutrophils in vitro that was comparable to that of natural LTB, with a concentration of 3 X 10(9-9) M eliciting a one-half maximum response. In contrast, the racemic mixture of 5R,12R- and 5S,12S-6,10-trans,8,14-cis, the racemic mixture of 5S,12R- and 5R,12S- 6,10-trans,8,14-cis, the 5S,12R-6,8-trans,10,14-cis, the 5S,12R-6,8,10- trans,14-cis, and the 5S,12S-6,8,10-trans,14-cis stereoisomers required concentrations of 3 X 10(-7) to 1 X 10(-6) M to elicit comparable responses. Only natural LTB and its synthetic counterpart elicited a local neutrophil infiltration when injected into the skin of the rhesus monkey at 10 ng and 100 ng per site. Natural and synthetic LTB at a concentration of 3 X 10(-8) M each provoked an EC25 contractile response of guinea pig pulmonary parenchymal strips in vitro, whereas the other four tested stereoisomers of 5,12-di-HETE were inactive at this concentration.

23e3ceb610884251bda54ce98a4d7a4b5ac12371,Giant oxygen isotope shift in the magnetoresistive perovskite La1–xCaxMnO3+y,"FERROMAGNETIC perovskites of the form La1–XMexMnO3–Y (where Me is Ca or Sr) have been known1 since 1950, but there has been a recent resurgence of interest following the discovery of giant magnetoresistance in this class of compounds2,3. The compounds contain both Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions; as the electronic ground state of the Mn3+ ions is degenerate, their energy is lowered by a spontaneous distortion of the surrounding lattice—the Jahn–Teller effect4. The charge carriers in these materials are strongly coupled to (and mediate the ferromagnetic interaction between) the manganese ions5, suggesting that localized lattice distortions could also play an important role in determining the electronic and magnetic properties of these compounds. Here we investigate this possibility by examining the effect on the ferromagnetic transition temperature of varying the oxygen isotope mass (replacing 16O with 18O). For La0.8Ca0.2MnO3+y, we measure an isotope shift of >20 K, significantly larger than that found for any magnetic or electronic phase transition in other oxides. In contrast, we observe no significant isotope shift for the structurally related ferromagnet SrRuO3, in which the Jahn–Teller effect is negligible. These results imply that the large isotope shift arises from coupling of the charge carriers to Jahn–Teller lattice distortions, and we suggest that such Jahn–Teller 'polarons' may also be responsible for the magnetoresistive properties of these materials.",1996,16,434,1,3,38,53,45,37,35,28,22,19,26

Treatment with 20 microg/day of the GHRH antagonist JV-1-36 or MZ-5-156 and 60 microg/day of the somatostatin analog RC-160 for 25 days decreased tumor volume by 70.9% (P < 0.01), 58.3% (P < 0.05), and 60.6% (P < 0.01), respectively, vs. the control value. The levels of GH in serum were decreased in all of the treated groups, but only RC-160 significantly reduced serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). The levels of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for IGF-I and -II and for their receptors in OV-1063 tumors were investigated by multiplex RT-PCR. No expression of mRNA for IGF-I was detected, but treatment with JV-1-136 caused a 51.8% decrease (P < 0.05) in the level of mRNA for IGF-II in tumors. Exposure of OV-1063 cells cultured in vitro to GHRH, IGF-I, or IGF-II significantly (P < 0.05) stimulated cell growth, but 10(-5) mol/L JV-1-36 nearly completely inhibited (P < 0.001) OV-1063 cell proliferation. OV-1063 tumors expressed mRNA for GHRH receptors and showed the presence of binding sites for GHRH. Our results indicate that antagonistic analogs of GHRH and the somatostatin analog RC-160 inhibit the growth of epithelial ovarian cancers. The effects of RC-160 seem to be exerted more on the pituitary GH-hepatic IGF-I axis, whereas GHRH antagonists appear to reduce IGF-II production and interfere with the autocrine regulatory pathway. The antitumorigenic action of GHRH antagonists appears to be mediated by GHRH receptors found in OV-1063 tumors.",2001,45,53,2,4,7,4,2,11,2,1,4,2,3

We characterize, through in vivo optical imaging, the development and stability of the Bicoid morphogen gradient in Drosophila embryos that express a Bicoid-eGFP fusion protein. The gradient is established rapidly (approximately 1 hr after fertilization), with nuclear Bicoid concentration rising and falling during mitosis. Interphase levels result from a rapid equilibrium between Bicoid uptake and removal. Initial interphase concentration in nuclei in successive cycles is constant (+/-10%), demonstrating a form of gradient stability, but it subsequently decays by approximately 30%. Both direct photobleaching measurements and indirect estimates of Bicoid-eGFP diffusion constants (D < or = 1 microm(2)/s) provide a consistent picture of Bicoid transport on short ( approximately min) time scales but challenge traditional models of long-range gradient formation.

The 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA for Chinese hamster hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase contains an optional exon of 59 nucleotides located 10 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site. About 50% of the mRNAs contain this exon, and the other 50% lack it owing to differential intron splicing. We show that the two transcripts are found in similar ratios in multiple tissues of the Syrian hamster, including the brain. The relative amounts of the two transcripts in brain and liver are constant from day 0 to day 75 of life. A similar alternative splicing pattern for hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase was observed in three human tissues: cultured fibroblasts, fetal adrenal gland, and fetal liver. A cDNA for human synthase had 90% homology to the hamster sequence in the region corresponding to the optional exon. This sequence contains a 20 out of 26 nucleotide match with the sequence immediately upstream of the initiator AUG codon in the mRNA for hamster hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the enzyme that follows the synthase in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway.

Strong expression of protein fragments containing destruction boxes, such as the first 70 residues of Cdc13 (N70), inhibits the growth of Schizosaccharomyces pombe at metaphase. This inhibition can be overcome either by removal of all lysine residues from N70 using site‐directed mutagenesis (K0‐N70) or by raising the concentration of intracellular ubiquitin. Consistent with the idea that competition for ubiquitin accounts for some of its inhibitory effects, wild‐type N70 not only stabilized D‐box proteins, but also Rum1 and Cdc18, which are degraded by a different pathway. The K0‐N70 construct was neither polyubiquitinated nor degraded in vitro, but it blocked the growth of strains of yeast in which anaphase‐promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) function was compromised by mutation, and specifically inhibited proteolysis of APC/C substrates in vivo. Both K0‐N70 and 20‐residue D‐box peptides blocked polyubiquitination of other D‐box‐containing substrates in a cell‐free ubiquitination assay system.

4f425851e660138badfb44d0219c290aa5c7e7fa,Cytoplasmic pH regulation in thymic lymphocytes by an amiloride- sensitive Na+/H+ antiport,"The mechanisms underlying cytoplasmic pH (pHi) regulation in rat thymic lymphocytes were studied using trapped fluorescein derivatives as pHi indicators. Cells that were acid-loaded with nigericin in choline+ media recovered normal pHi upon addition of extracellular Na+ (Nao+). The cytoplasmic alkalinization was accompanied by medium acidification and an increase in cellular Na+ content and was probably mediated by a Nao+/Hi+ antiport. At normal [Na+]i, Nao+/Hi+ exchange was undetectable at pHi greater than or equal to 6.9 but was markedly stimulated by internal acidification. Absolute rates of H+ efflux could be calculated from the Nao+-induced delta pHi using a buffering capacity of 25 mmol X liter-1 X pH-1, measured by titration of intact cells with NH4+. At pHi = 6.3, pHo = 7.2, and [Na+]o = 140 mM, H+ extrusion reached 10 mmol X liter-1 X min-1. Nao+/Hi+ exchange was stimulated by internal Na+ depletion and inhibited by lowering pHo and by addition of amiloride (apparent Ki = 2.5 microM). Inhibition by amiloride was competitive with respect to Nao+. Hi+ could also exchange for Lio+, but not for K+, Rb+, Cs+, or choline+. Nao+/Hi+ countertransport has an apparent 1:1 stoichiometry and is electrically silent. However, a small secondary hyperpolarization follows recovery from acid-loading in Na+ media. This hyperpolarization is amiloride- and ouabain-sensitive and probably reflects activation of the electrogenic Na+-K+ pump. At normal Nai+ values, the Nao+/Hi+ antiport of thymocytes is ideally suited for the regulation of pHi. The system can also restore [Na+]i in Na+-depleted cells. In this instance the exchanger, in combination with the considerable cytoplasmic buffering power, will operate as a [Na+]i- regulatory mechanism.",1984,43,398,11,8,22,23,35,32,47,37,24,21,15

TRAF family members interact directly with these receptors. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, TANK was identified as an intracellular protein without previous homologs that interacts with all three known TRAF family members. In cotransfection experiments, TANK and TRAF2 activate NF-kappaB synergistically, requiring both the amino-terminal portion of TANK and the ring finger domain of TRAF2. TANK has a negatively acting carboxyl terminus and is constitutively inactive, but TRAF2 binding overcomes the internal inhibitory influence. We propose that ligand binding to CD40 or TNFR II leads to the formation of a TRAF2/TANK complex, mediating NF-kappaB activation.",1996,26,286,24,5,27,33,43,24,11,15,14,9,8

N-terminal arginylation of BiP (also known as GRP78), protein disulphide isomerase and calreticulin is co-induced with autophagy during innate immune responses to cytosolic foreign DNA or proteasomal inhibition, associated with increased ubiquitylation. Arginylated BiP (R-BiP) is induced by and associated with cytosolic misfolded proteins destined for p62 (also known as sequestosome 1, SQSTM1) bodies. R-BiP binds the autophagic adaptor p62 through the interaction of its N-terminal arginine with the p62 ZZ domain. This allosterically induces self-oligomerization and aggregation of p62 and increases p62 interaction with LC3, leading to p62 targeting to autophagosomes and selective lysosomal co-degradation of R-BiP and p62 together with associated cargoes. In this autophagic mechanism, Nt-arginine functions as a delivery determinant, a degron and an activating ligand.

We find that the renormalized effective Hamiltonians can be approximated in a large range of widths by introducing similarity factors and the running coupling constant. This approximation loses accuracy for the small widths on the order of the bound state energy and it is improved by using the expansion in powers of the running coupling constant. The coupling constant for small widths is of order 1. The small width effective Hamiltonian is projected on a small subset of the effective basis states. The resulting small matrix is diagonalized exactly and the bound state energy of the original theory is obtained with accuracy of the order of 10% using the first three terms in the perturbative expansion of the effective Hamiltonian. We briefly describe options for improving the accuracy. @S0556-2821~98!03006-9#,1997,15,32,1,4,2,0,1,2,1,1,1,3,2

PEMFC technology since the 1960s highlights the ‘quantum jumps’ both in the fundamental areas of research (Part I) and in the engineering and technology and developmental (Part II), which are leading to the era of promising applications. This part of the review is on the ‘quantum jumps’ in the fundamental areas of research, which have enabled the rapid advances in the technology development, i.e. (i) transition from polystyrene sulfonic acid to perfluorosulfonic acid membranes; (ii) a 10- to 100-fold reduction in the platinum loading in electrode by using nanosize electrocatalyst particles supported on high surface area carbon and impregnation of the proton conducting electrolyte into the active layer of the electrode; (iii) optimization of structure of electrode and of membrane and electrode assembly to enhance power densities to 0.5–0.7 W cm −2 at desirable efficiencies; (iv) using perfluorosulfonic acid membranes for DMFCs instead of liquid electrolytes to attain reasonably good efficiencies and power densities.

Bodansky and A. Mazur 2 reported on the very marked anticholinesterase activity on blood and tissues of diisopropylfluorophosphate (D.F.P.). The influence of the anticholinesterase D.F.P. on the respiratory, cardiac and the vasomotor reflexes induced by the carotid sinus presso-ceptors in the dog has been investigated. Method. In the dog, under choralosane anesthesia, the efferent arteries of the carotid sinus were ligated, care being taken not to sever the pressoceptive innervation. The cephalic end of the common carotid artery was connected with a pressure device. By means of this technic, the hydrostatic pressure may be increased or decreased in the isolated presso-sensitive innervated carotid sinus. The cardio-vascular and respiratory reactions of the animal to the intracarotid sinus pressure changes were registered before and after injection of the anticholinesterase D.F.P. The cholinesterase activity of the blood was determined by means of the method described by A. L. Delaunois and H. Casier. 3 Results. Intravenous injections of doses of D.F.P. (0.12-1 mg/kg) inhibiting completely the cholinesterase activity of the blood, do not stimulate the respiratory center and do not affect either the heart rate or the blood pressure. The cardio-vascular and respiratory reflexes induced by increase or decrease of the intracarotid sinus pressure are not affected by the administration of D.F.P. and the inhibition of the cholinesterase activity. The above results do not support the theory of a cholinergic transmission of the respiratory and cardio-vascular reflexes induced by means of a physiological stimulation of the carotid sinus pressoceptors.",1946,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3aaad10ad4c9bc7f055d9d2b710cc8a4a88441a4,Receptor and G betagamma isoform-specific interactions with G protein-coupled receptor kinases.,"The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate and desensitize agonist-occupied GPCRs. GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation is preceded by the agonist-dependent membrane association of this enzyme. Previous in vitro studies with purified proteins have suggested that this translocation may be mediated by the recruitment of GRK2 to the plasma membrane by its interaction with the free betagamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (G betagamma). Here we demonstrate that this mechanism operates in intact cells and that specificity is imparted by the selective interaction of discrete pools of G betagamma with receptors and GRKs. Treatment of Cos-7 cells transiently overexpressing GRK2 with a beta-receptor agonist promotes a 3-fold increase in plasma membrane-associated GRK2. This translocation of GRK2 is inhibited by the carboxyl terminus of GRK2, a known G betagamma sequestrant. Furthermore, in cells overexpressing both GRK2 and G beta1 gamma2, activation of lysophosphatidic acid receptors leads to the rapid and transient formation of a GRK/G betagamma complex. That G betagamma specificity exists at the level of the GPCR and the GRK is indicated by the observation that a GRK2/G betagamma complex is formed after agonist occupancy of the lysophosphatidic acid and beta-adrenergic but not thrombin receptors. In contrast to GRK2, GRK3 forms a G betagamma complex after stimulation of all three GPCRs. This G betagamma binding specificity of the GRKs is also reflected at the level of the purified proteins. Thus the GRK2 carboxyl terminus binds G beta1 and G beta2 but not G beta3, while the GRK3 fusion protein binds all three G beta isoforms. This study provides a direct demonstration of a role for G betagamma in mediating the agonist-stimulated translocation of GRK2 and GRK3 in an intact cellular system and demonstrates isoform specificity in the interaction of these components.",1997,27,193,6,5,26,19,13,10,7,13,7,13,6

Substitution slightly affects the binding and reaction of GTP with this group I catalytic center; kcat/Km varies over a three-fold range. The base of N260 therefore communicates with the rG site, but is unlikely to bond directly to GTP. Different nucleotides at this position also alter the binding of L-arginine to the intron, measured by inhibition of the reaction with GTP. Effects of similar small magnitude on interaction of RNA with both GTP and L-arginine support the previous argument from kinetic and structural comparison (Yarus, M. (1988) Science 240, 1751) that placed the two ligands of the RNA in the same binding site. G260 RNA shows the greatest affinity for both D- and L-arginine, but uniquely lacks stereoselectivity for the amino acid. Therefore G260 alters spatial relations within the G site, otherwise conserved in C260, U260, and A260 RNA's. Guanyl urea was used as a probe for the G/guanidino H-bonding part of the rG/arginine site. G260 RNA's dissociation constant for guanyl urea is similar to that of the other RNA's, suggesting that G260 RNA is unaltered at the G/guanidino end of the rG/arginine binding site. To account for all observations, we suggest that the G260 substitution alters the relative location of the RNA backbone near the 5' exon-intron junction, making this location more flexible and closer to the alpha-NH3+'s of L- and D-arginine.",1989,0,5,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,1,0

Part 2.—Photoreduction,"Both manganese(II) and (III) porphyrins exhibit low-intensity, short-lived luminescence in ethanol solution at 77 K. Manganese(II) porphyrins are stable towards photodecomposition when irradiated in fluid solution but undergo efficient photoreduction in the presence of a good hydrogen donor such as ascorbic acid. Manganese(III) porphyrins are reduced to the manganese(II) compounds when irradiated with visible light but the quantum yields are very low (≈ 10–4). In water, the quantum yield depends upon pH and excitation wavelength but is independent of the nature of the water-solubilising group.

f7aed183a4381a3abf7ce76afe0a479e3d17b91a,"Reduced maternal expression of adrenomedullin disrupts fertility, placentation, and fetal growth in mice.","Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional peptide vasodilator that is essential for life. Plasma AM expression dramatically increases during pregnancy, and alterations in its levels are associated with complications of pregnancy including fetal growth restriction (FGR) and preeclampsia. Using AM+/- female mice with genetically reduced AM expression, we demonstrate that fetal growth and placental development are seriously compromised by this modest decrease in expression. AM+/- female mice had reduced fertility characterized by FGR. The incidence of FGR was also influenced by the genotype of the embryo, since AM-/- embryos were more often affected than either AM+/- or AM+/+ embryos. We demonstrate that fetal trophoblast cells and the maternal uterine wall have coordinated and localized increases in AM gene expression at the time of implantation. Placentas from growth-restricted embryos showed defects in trophoblast cell invasion, similar to defects that underlie human preeclampsia and placenta accreta. Our data provide a genetic in vivo model to implicate both maternal and, to a lesser extent, embryonic levels of AM in the processes of implantation, placentation, and subsequent fetal growth. This study provides the first genetic evidence to our knowledge to suggest that a modest reduction in human AM expression during pregnancy may have an unfavorable impact on reproduction.",2006,68,95,1,0,5,6,6,5,10,10,11,11,6

As a test of this idea, two retroviral vectors--one encoding a hammer-head ribozyme designed to cleave lacZ transcripts and another encoding the lacZ messenger RNA--were coexpressed inside retroviral packaging cells. Because of the retroviral packaging signal, the ribozyme would be expected to colocalize with the lacZ-containing viral genomic RNA but not with the lacZ messenger RNA. The ribozyme was found to reduce the titer of infectious virus containing lacZ by 90 percent, but had no effect on translation of lacZ messenger RNA. These results indicate that sorting gene inhibitors to appropriate intracellular sites may increase their effectiveness.",1993,17,197,3,1,14,24,19,24,19,20,14,17,10

(-)Isoproterenol competition curves with (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol revealed that isoproterenol binds to the beta-adrenergic receptor with two distinct affinity states having high (KH) and low (KL) dissociation constants. In the presence of guanine nucleotides the isoproterenol competition curve steepened and had a higher EC50 (50% displacement). This was due to a transition of the high affinity state to a uniformly low affinity state. Using computer modeling of these competition curves, we have demonstrated that in hyperthyroidism, the isoproterenol curve in the absence of guanine nucleotides is shifted to the left with the EC50 changing from 180 ± 40 to 80 ± 20 nM (p There was no significant alteration in any of these parameters in hypothyroid animals.

The distribution of recoil momenta q was calculated for q of order of the electron mass and it is shown that the recoil distribution is independent of the mass of the recoil particle if appropriate variables are used. It is also explicitly shown that the mass of the recoil particle does not make any difference in the recoil distribution for very small q (of order q/sub min/). The total cross section must therefore be independent of the mass of the recoil particle in the bigh- energy limit, as previously stated by Borsellino. The Wheeler-Lamb result for pair production in the field of a bound electron was also justified. The results also describe the electromagnetic production of any fermion pair if certain restrictions are satisfied. (auth)",1959,0,23,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1

Here we trace the defect to a rearrangement in the gene encoding SREBP-2, a membrane-bound transcription factor that regulates cholesterol homeostasis. SREBP-2 is an 1139-amino acid protein that is bound to extranuclear membranes via a carboxy-terminal attachment domain. In sterol-depleted cells a protease liberates the amino-terminal fragment (approximately 480 amino acids). This fragment, which contains the transcriptional activation and bHLH-Zip domains, translocates to the nucleus. 25-Hydroxycholesterol abolishes protease activity and halts transcription. SRD-1 cells produce a soluble, truncated form of SREBP-2 (amino acids 1-460) that lacks the membrane attachment domain and activates transcription directly, bypassing the sterol-regulated proteolytic step. Although SRD-1 cells produce full-length SREBP-2 from the wild-type allele and a related transcription factor, SREBP-1, they fail to cleave both of these precursors, indicating that the truncated form of SREBP-2 down-regulates the protease through a form of end-product feedback inhibition. The current data provide genetic evidence for the previously proposed model in which cholesterol homeostasis is controlled by sterol-regulated proteolysis of a membrane-bound bHLH-Zip transcription factor.",1994,22,103,2,1,7,11,9,7,3,4,5,6,7

Exocytosis requires the assembly of SNARE complexes formed by the vesicle protein Synaptobrevin and the membrane proteins Syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25. We analyzed the role of Munc18-1, a cytosolic binding partner of Syntaxin-1, in large dense-core vesicle (LDCV) secretion. Calcium-dependent LDCV exocytosis was reduced 10-fold in mouse chromaffin cells lacking Munc18-1, but the kinetic properties of the remaining release, including single fusion events, were not different from controls. Concomitantly, mutant cells displayed a 10-fold reduction in morphologically docked LDCVs. Moreover, acute overexpression of Munc18-1 in bovine chromaffin cells increased the amount of releasable vesicles and accelerated vesicle supply. We conclude that Munc18-1 functions upstream of SNARE complex formation and promotes LDCV docking.",2001,112,394,26,1,9,23,35,31,21,34,29,28,20

RBs do not appear to be tissue specific, since they are also induced in a rat glioma cell line transfected with mu delta CH1 and L chain genes. Efficient RB biogenesis requires H-L assembly and polymerization. The mutant Ig is partially degraded in a pre-Golgi compartment. The remnant, however, becomes an insoluble lattice when intersubunit disulphide bonds are formed. The resulting insoluble aggregate accumulates in RBs. Replacing the COOH-terminal cysteine of mu delta CH1 chains with alanine reverses the RB-phenotype: the double mutant mu ala delta CH1 chains assemble noncovalently with L and are secreted as H2L2 complexes. Similarly, secretion of mu delta CH1 chains can be induced by culturing transfectant cells in the presence of reducing agents. The presence of RBs does not alter transport of other secretory or membrane molecules, nor does it affect cell division. Resident proteins of the ER and other secretory proteins are not concentrated in RBs, implying sorting at the ER level. Sorting could be the result of the specific molecular structure of the insoluble lattice. We propose that RBs represent a general response of the cell to the accumulation of abundant, nondegradable protein(s) that fail to exit from the ER.",1991,54,132,4,0,2,7,1,4,5,6,3,8,5

The injection of bovine catalytic (C) subunits into sensory neurons is sufficient to produce protein synthesis-dependent LTF. Early in the LTF induced by serotonin (5-HT), an autonomous PKA is generated through the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis of regulatory (R) subunits. The degradation of R occurs during an early time window and appears to be a key function of proteasomes in LTF. Lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, blocks the facilitation induced by 5-HT, and this block is rescued by injecting C subunits. R is degraded through an allosteric mechanism requiring an elevation of cAMP coincident with the induction of a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase.",1999,149,177,13,6,8,5,15,14,7,6,14,6,14

The polyhydrogenated species are unstable towards light and undergo oxidative degradation, with, in the case of C 60 H 36 , formation of C 60 H 18 as an intermediate. Reduction of these fullerenes by zinc/concentrated DCl gives C 60 H 44 and C 70 H 48 as the highest hydrogenated products; the greater incorporation of deuterium is attributed to the greater C-D bond energy. In the absence of light and oxygen, C 60 H 36 exhibits high thermal stability.

Water clarification experiments on quartz sand suspensions under varying pH were carried out by using ACFs formed from polyelectrolytes. In the case of an ACF where polycation and polyanion were both strongly ionizable polyelectrolytes, the variation of pH produced no significant effect except for a charge reversal of the suspended solid at the isoelectric point (i.e.p.). Sudden change in the flocculating efficiency takes place at the point where the polycation and the polyanion which are to form an ACF are equal in number of ionizable functional groups (nc = na). In the case of an ACF containing weak polyelectrolyte(s), the situation appeared to be quite different; the pH showed appreciable effects not only at the i.e.p. but also at a point far from the i.e.p. It was found, however, that the results can be explained in quite the same manner as before, if we take into account the variation in degree of dissociation of weak polyelectrolyte(s); the pH where the sudden change in the flocculating efficiency was observed simply corresponds to the point where the polycation and the polyanion are the same in number of really ionized functional groups.",1988,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is a wealth of ancillary data available, including Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope optical, UKIRT-K, Spitzer-IRAC/MIPS, and Herschel-SPIRE. This work adds submillimeter imaging with the SCUBA2 camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and near-infrared imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope. The mid/far-infrared (M/FIR) data detect an Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxy spatially coincident with the central galaxy, with L_(IR) = 6.2 ± 0.9 × 10^(12) L⊙. The detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at z = 1.7 in a Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the source implies the FIR luminosity is dominated by star formation (an Active Galactic Nucleus contribution of 20%) with a rate of ~860 ± 130 M⊙ yr^(−1). The optical source corresponding to the IR emission is likely a chain of >10 individual clumps arranged as ""beads on a string"" over a linear scale of 66 kpc. Its morphology and proximity to the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) imply a gas-rich interaction at the center of the cluster triggered the star formation. This system indicates that wet mergers may be an important process in forming the stellar mass of BCGs at early times.",2015,83,34,8,2,11,5,5,3,7,1,0,0,0

Volume I introduces the foundations of quantum field theory. The development is fresh and logical throughout, with each step carefully motivated by what has gone before. After a brief historical outline, the book begins with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow. Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence. The classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics are presented in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. It contains much original material, and is peppered with examples and insights drawn from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle research. Exercises are included at the end of each chapter.

We found amplification and enhanced expression of the cellular oncogene c-myc in both COLO 320 DM and HSR cells, and we were able to show that the homogeneously staining regions of the COLO 320 HSR marker chromosome contain amplified c-myc. From previous and present karyotypes, it appears that the homogeneously staining regions reside on a distorted X chromosome. Therefore, amplification of c-myc has been accompanied by translocation of the gene from its normal position on chromosome 8 (8q24). Because double minute chromosomes were features of primary cultures from the original tumor, it seems reasonable to suspect that amplification of c-myc may have contributed to tumorigenesis.",1983,0,667,9,15,52,79,46,39,38,37,41,25,30

The thickness of the GaInN active layer was varied from 100 to 400 nm, while the thickness of both n-type and p-type GaN layers was kept constant. A semitransparent ohmic contact to p-type GaN was formed by electron-beam evaporation of Ni/Au (5 nm/5 nm). The film thickness of p-GaN was 50 nm. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device with a 400 nm GaInN layer exceeded 60% at a wavelength of approximately 380 nm. The transparency of the Ni/Au electrode was 68%. Therefore, the internal quantum efficiency of this device exceeded 95%. Note that this device emitted green light when a forward voltage was applied. The electroluminescence peak wavelength was approximately 525 nm, which was much longer than the EQE peak wavelength. The origin of this large emission shift is discussed.

The crystal structure of the MoaB protein from E. coli was determined by multiple anomalous dispersion at 2.1 angstroms A resolution and refined to an R factor of 20.4% (Rfree = 25.0%). The protein is a 32-symmetric hexamer, with the monomers consisting of a central beta-sheet flanked by helices on both sides. The overall fold of the monomer is similar to those of the MogA protein of E. coli, the G-domains of rat and human gephyrin and the G-domains of Cnx1 protein from A. thaliana, all of which are involved in the insertion of an unknown molybdenum species into molybdopterin to form the molybdenum cofactor. Furthermore, the MoaB protein shows significant sequence similarity to the cinnamon protein from Drosophila melanogaster. In addition to other functions, all these proteins are involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor and have been shown to bind molybdopterin. The close structural homology to MogA and the gephyrin and Cnx1 domains suggests that MoaB may bind a hitherto unidentified pterin compound, possibly an intermediate in molybdopterin biosynthesis.",2004,43,9,1,0,1,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,1

The approach is based on the idea of enhancement of the basic parameters, entering the BCS formula for T c : the electron–phonon interaction constant, the density of states and the energy of mediating quasiparticles. The known examples of materials with a relatively high- T c are examined. The author’s idea of finding a substance forming a “crystalline excitonium” phase (1978) is presented. Since the BCS formula represents only an isotropic model, the role of anisotropy is analyzed within the author’s model for high- T c layered cuprates. The main conclusion is, that anisotropy of the spectrum and a long-ranged interaction widens the options for obtaining SHT.",2008,7,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0

As a consequence of the surface restructuring the reactivity may also be affected, and eventually new crystal planes may even be formed (facetting).

This is in sharp contrast to the case for negatively selected C57BL/6 spleen cells acutely depleted of alloreactivity. No evidence for suppression was found in cell mixture experiments. We have shown elsewhere that our neonatally tolerized animals have a centrally induced delection-type tolerance in the absence of obvious suppression.2 We now suggest that in the neonatally tolerized mouse, chronic, central delection of anti-H-2k clones during early T cell ontogeny eliminates the major source of cells able to give rise, via somatic mutation and expansion, to anti-H-2Kk + vaccinia specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTL-P) in the adult. A similar mechanism may operate in the (k + b) leads to b chimera; however, the presence of H-2kxb accessory and presenting cells may permit the eventual generation (via cross-stimulation) of an H-2k-restricted vaccinia-specific repertoire. This would account for our observation of such ""aberrant recognition"" CTL-P emerging in the spleens of older (k x b) leads to b chimeras.",1982,38,5,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0

Here we use the Raman G peak to assess the response of carbon fibres to the application of strain, with reference to the response of graphene itself. Our data highlight the predominance of the in-plane graphene properties in all graphitic structures examined. A universal master plot relating the G peak strain sensitivity to tensile modulus of all types of carbon fibres, as well as graphene, is presented. We derive a universal value of—average—phonon shift rate with axial stress of around −5ω0−1 (cm−1 MPa−1), where ω0 is the G peak position at zero stress for both graphene and carbon fibre with annular morphology.

Exit of cholesterol from lysosomes requires two proteins, membrane-bound Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and soluble NPC2. NPC2 binds cholesterol with its isooctyl side chain buried and its 3beta-hydroxyl exposed. Here, we describe high-resolution structures of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1 and complexes with cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol. NPC1(NTD) binds cholesterol in an orientation opposite to NPC2: 3beta-hydroxyl buried and isooctyl side chain exposed. Cholesterol transfer from NPC2 to NPC1(NTD) requires reorientation of a helical subdomain in NPC1(NTD), enlarging the opening for cholesterol entry. NPC1 with point mutations in this subdomain (distinct from the binding subdomain) cannot accept cholesterol from NPC2 and cannot restore cholesterol exit from lysosomes in NPC1-deficient cells. We propose a working model wherein after lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL-cholesteryl esters, cholesterol binds NPC2, which transfers it to NPC1(NTD), reversing its orientation and allowing insertion of its isooctyl side chain into the outer lysosomal membranes.",2009,56,542,37,9,42,43,44,48,44,33,47,42,36

This investigation, which includes a description of a model structure for the H52R/T56W double mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain, was carried out for the two proteins in both the free and DNA-bound states. The double residue replacement at positions 52 and 56 within the DNA recognition helix of vnd/NK-2 has been shown to lead to a significant secondary structural modification resulting in an increase in the length of the recognition helix for the unbound protein. These structural changes are accompanied by corresponding changes in the T(1) and T(1)(rho) relaxation times as well as in the heteronuclear Overhauser effect (XNOE) values that show that the structural stability of the protein is enhanced by the two residue replacements. The values of the rotational anisotropy, D(parallel)/D(perpendicular), derived from analysis of the (15)N T(1) and T(1)(rho) relaxation values are small (1.189 for the unbound homeodomain and 1.110 for the bound homeodomain; both analyzed as prolate ellipsoids of revolution). A comparison of the T(2) values of the wild type and double mutant homeodomain reveals the presence of a low-frequency exchange contribution for the wild type analogue. These relaxation studies show that the motional behavior of the protein primarily reflects the tertiary structure and stability of the homeodomain backbone as well as the respective changes induced upon site-directed residue replacement or DNA binding.",2001,0,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

With incubation, nitrotyrosine-containing BSA lost its epitope to a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognized nitrotyrosine-containing proteins. In the presence of protease inhibitors, the loss of the nitrotyrosine epitope occurred without protein degradation and hydrolysis. This activity was found in supernatant but not particulate fractions of spleen homogenates. The factor was heat labile, was sensitive to trypsin treatment, and was retained after passage through a membrane with a 10-kDa retention. The activity was time- and protein-concentration dependent. The activity increased about 2-fold in spleen extracts with endotoxin (bacterial lipopolysaccharide) treatment of animals, suggesting that the activity is inducible or regulatable. Other nitrotyrosine-containing proteins also served as substrates, while free nitrotyrosine and some endogenous nitrotyrosine-containing proteins in tissue extracts were poor substrates. Although the product and possible cofactors for this reaction have not yet been identified, this activity may be a ""nitrotyrosine denitrase"" that reverses protein nitration and, thus, decreases peroxynitrite toxicity. This activity was not observed in homogenates from rat liver or kidney, suggesting that there may also be some tissue specificity for the apparent denitrase activity.",1998,24,269,3,1,11,27,28,23,21,12,15,16,12

The first two processes have been treated in quantum mechanics by Bethe, Moller, and Bloch in a very satisfactory way. A provisional estimation of the order of magnitude to be expected in the third process has been given by Heitler. The result obtained was that the cross-section ϕ for the energy loss by radiation for very fast particles (if the primary energy E ≫ mc 2) is of the order ϕ ∽ Z2/137 ( e 2/ mc 2)2, (1) Where Z is the nuclear charge. It is the aim of the present paper to discuss in greater detain the rate of loss of energy by this third process and its dependence on the primary energy; in particular we shall consider the effect of screening .

Much has been written about the mental processes that lead to innovation but this is one of the rare times that a group of people who themselves have participated in the act of innovati,on have been asked to shed some light on the factors which contributed to the generation of a new concept. It is not difficult to document the apparently important features; they have been told many times before. Indeed the telling and retelling with embellishments of “the day that etc.” gradually takes on a ring of authenticity that eventually becomes fact in itself. On this occasion, however, we shall try to analyze once again just exactly what did transpire, with the full understanding that with all the best effort at objectivity, it may still not be an accurate account of the subtle interplay between people that certainly played a most important role in our own work. The charge-coupled device concept is one that is basically a structure that called upon existing technology and was stimulated by the analogous work that preceded it in magnetic bubbles. All the ingredients necessary for the innovation were found within Bell Laboratories. The now well-known work at the Philips Eindhoven Laboratory by Sangster [l] and his colleagues on the Bucket Brigade was unknown to us. The importance of the Bucket Brigade as a member of the family of charge transfer devices is well recognized, and we want at this point to recognize the important contribution to device technology that has been made by the work a t Philips. In :late 1969, the device area of Bell Laboratories was strongly oriented towards innovation and exploratory development of new devices. Strong efforts were being directed towards such fields as IMPATT diodes, GaAs lasers, nonlinear optics, solid-state lasers, holography, Gunn diodes, magnetic bubbles, and the silicon diode array came.ra tube. Of particular interest was the work on magnetic bubbles. It was apparent that a radically new approach to signal processing was being brought into existence. Those of us who were working on semiconductor integrated circuits looked at the work in magnetic bubbles with some awe. In the magnetic bubbles it seemed that a new class of devices was in the offing in which there was a very natural and appealing way of storing and manipulating bits with a one-to-one correspondence to the digital format. It could. be argued that semiconductor integrated circuits, important as they were, had not yet broken away from the circuit concepts that had evolved through the use of dis-",1976,8,26,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Determination of the potency of such substances, as specified by the Council, is to be made on the basis of the magnitude of the reticulocyte response induced by the administration of the liver substitute. Although such a response has been used as an indication of qualitative potency of liver and substitutes for it since the introduction of liver therapy, it has been almost uniformly recognized that the magnitude of this response is not necessarily a measure of the power of a substance to produce erythrocytes, which is the fundamental problem concerned in the treatment of pernicious anemia.

b6277b3324449344d1db14e4edac1f8e7de22b4e,LHRH receptor expression in sarcomas of bone and soft tissue,"Abstract Aim: Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) is a neurohormone, secreted by the hypothalamus, which regulates the secretion of gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary. LHRH acts by binding to receptors located in the pituitary gland. These receptors (LHRH receptors) have also been found in the cytoplasm of many tumor cells that involve both the reproductive and non-reproductive organs. These receptors have been demonstrated in prostate and breast cancers, endometrial carcinomas, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, carcinoma of liver, pancreas and skin. So far, the expression of LHRH receptors on sarcomas (i.e. malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin) has not been studied, except for endometrial sarcomas. It has also been demonstrated that both LHRH agonists and antagonists can down-regulate these receptors and thus inhibit these tumor cells. Another major therapeutic implication is that these receptors can be targeted specifically by peptides conjugated to anti-cancer drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine if LHRH receptors are expressed in primary and/or metastatic sarcomas of human origin. Methods: We looked at LHRH receptor expression in 38 consecutive sarcoma specimens, using immunohistochemistry. The specimens were either from office biopsy or from resected tumor; these were confirmed as sarcomas by histopathological examination. The receptor staining characteristics and the staining intensity were also documented. The pattern of staining was classified either as “focal or diffuse staining of the cytoplasm” and the intensity of staining was graded on a scale from 1+ to 4+. Results: Positive receptor staining was seen in 25 of the 38 (66%) specimens. Twelve of the specimens stained diffusely and 13 had focally positive staining. Three tumors had 1+ staining, 10 had 2+ staining, six had 3+ staining, and six tumors had 4+ staining. The tumors included undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, osteosarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, metastatic chondrosarcoma and chordoma. Conclusion: Sarcomas express LHRH receptors with a varying incidence and degree. Our study suggests that those sarcomas that are LHRH receptor positive could potentially be treated with targeted chemotherapy.",2016,42,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

We have examined the patterns of odorant receptor expression in the rat olfactory epithelium to determine whether the mammalian olfactory system employs spatial segregation of sensory input to encode the identity of an odorant stimulus. In situ hybridization experiments with probes for 11 different odorant receptors demonstrate that sensory neurons expressing distinct receptors are topologically segregated into a small number of broad, yet circumscribed, zones within the olfactory epithelium. Within a given zone, however, olfactory neurons expressing a specific receptor appear to be randomly distributed, rather than spatially localized. The complex mammalian olfactory system may therefore compartmentalize the epithelium into anatomically and functionally discrete units, such that each zone expresses only a subset of the entire receptor repertoire.",1993,45,823,44,0,21,19,30,36,40,49,33,36,32

However, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies arise in approximately 20% of HIV-1-infected individuals, and details of their generation could provide a blueprint for effective vaccination. Here we report the isolation, evolution and structure of a broadly neutralizing antibody from an African donor followed from the time of infection. The mature antibody, CH103, neutralized approximately 55% of HIV-1 isolates, and its co-crystal structure with the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 revealed a new loop-based mechanism of CD4-binding-site recognition. Virus and antibody gene sequencing revealed concomitant virus evolution and antibody maturation. Notably, the unmutated common ancestor of the CH103 lineage avidly bound the transmitted/founder HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and evolution of antibody neutralization breadth was preceded by extensive viral diversification in and near the CH103 epitope. These data determine the viral and antibody evolution leading to induction of a lineage of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, and provide insights into strategies to elicit similar antibodies by vaccination.",2013,87,882,32,54,109,127,127,126,107,89,86,55,0

The X-ray crystal structure obtained shows a symmetrical structure, the free-base porphyrin being located at the center of a square formed by the four zinc atoms of the two zinc(II) bis-porphyrins. The two phenanthrolines connecting the zinc porphyrins are respectively above and below the plane of the central free-base porphyrin because of favorable CH-pi interactions between several porphyrinic assemblies within the crystal. Spectrophotometric and spectrofluorimetric titrations and studies reveal a high association constant for the porphyrinic assembly in the order of 10(14) M(-2). As expected, energy transfer from the zinc porphyrin component to the central free-base porphyrin quenches the fluorescence of the zinc porphyrin components whereas no sensitization of the emission of the free-base porphyrin was observed.

Functional properties were determined using patch-clamp techniques in the whole-cell and outside-out configurations. Large whole-cell currents were observed in cells expressing the alpha 1 beta 2, alpha 1 gamma 2, and alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subunit combinations. The unique characteristics of GABAR channels consisting of these subunit combinations depended upon the presence or absence of beta 2 and gamma 3 subunits. GABA-activated currents in cells expressing GABARs with the beta 2 subunit desensitized faster and showed greater outward rectification, and the channels had a shorter mean open time than GABARs composed of alpha 1 gamma 2 subunits. When the gamma 2 subunit was present the resulting GABAR channels had a larger conductance. The slope of the concentration-response curve was significantly steeper for GABARs composed of alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subunits compared with GABARs consisting of alpha 1 beta 2 or alpha 1 gamma 2 subunit combinations.",1990,30,523,9,5,24,45,33,34,47,41,36,33,26

We then applied tcTPC to identify more than 20 proteins residing in the vicinity of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), suggesting that PrP is embedded in specialized membrane regions with a subset of molecules that, like PrP, use a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor for membrane attachment.

Results: We have analyzed the basic steps of ATR activation in a biochemically defined system. Conclusion: ATR signaling requires enlargement of the DNA excision gap by EXO1. Significance: The six excision repair factors, ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, and EXO1 constitute the minimum essential set of proteins for ATR-activation upon UV-induced DNA damage. DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoints work in concert to help maintain genomic integrity. In vivo data suggest that these two global responses to DNA damage are coupled. It has been proposed that the canonical 30 nucleotide single-stranded DNA gap generated by nucleotide excision repair is the signal that activates the ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint response and that the signal is enhanced by gap enlargement by EXO1 (exonuclease 1) 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity. Here we have used purified core nucleotide excision repair factors (RPA, XPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, and XPF-ERCC1), core DNA damage checkpoint proteins (ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, RPA), and DNA damaged by a UV-mimetic agent to analyze the basic steps of DNA damage checkpoint response in a biochemically defined system. We find that checkpoint signaling as measured by phosphorylation of target proteins by the ATR kinase requires enlargement of the excision gap generated by the excision repair system by the 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity of EXO1. We conclude that, in addition to damaged DNA, RPA, XPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, XPF-ERCC1, ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, and EXO1 constitute the minimum essential set of factors for ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint response.",2014,68,52,2,7,14,13,8,4,2,1,3,0,0

48d2246ebbf474a32cecf3b2ede3c39185019aa8,Chimeric tumor necrosis factor receptors with constitutive signaling activity.,"Many hormone and cytokine receptors are crosslinked by their specific ligands, and multimerization is an essential step leading to the generation of a signal. In the case of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors (TNF-Rs), antibody-induced crosslinking is sufficient to trigger a cytolytic effect. However, the quaternary structural requirements for signaling--i.e., the formation of dimers, trimers, or higher-order multimers--have remained obscure. Moreover, it has not been clear whether the 55-kDa or 75-kDa TNF-R is responsible for initiation of cytolysis. We reasoned that an obligate receptor dimer, targeted to the plasma membrane, might continuously signal the presence of TNF despite the actual absence of the ligand. Such a molecule, inserted into an appropriate vector, could be used to project receptor-specific ""TNF-like"" activity to specific cells and tissues in vivo. Accordingly, we constructed sequences encoding chimeric receptors in which the extracellular domain of the mouse erythropoietin receptor (Epo-R) was fused to the ""stem,"" transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain of the two mouse TNF-Rs. Thus, the Epo-R group was used to drive dimerization of the TNF-R cytoplasmic domain. These chimeric proteins were well expressed in a variety of cell lines and bound erythropoietin at the cell surface. Both the 55-kDa and the 75-kDa Epo/TNF-R chimeras exerted a constitutive cytotoxic effect detected by cotransfection or clonogenic assay. Thus, despite the lack of structural homology between the cytoplasmic domains of the two TNF-Rs, a similar signaling endpoint was observed. Moreover, dimerization (rather than trimerization or higher-order multimerization) was sufficient for elicitation of a biological response.",1995,2,42,1,0,5,6,3,3,4,2,2,2,0
59417f667f24f456aedccefddee52a0d64d572d9,Determination of nucleotide sequences in DNA.,"In spite of the important role played by DNA sequences in living matter, it is only relatively recently that general methods for their determination have been developed. This is mainly because of the very large size of DNA molecules, the smallest being those of the simple bacteriophages such as qXl74 (which contains about 5,000 nucleotides). It was therefore difficult to develop methods with such complicated systems. There are however some relatively small RNA molecules notably the transfer RNAs of about 75 nucleotides, and these were used for the early studies on nucleic acid sequences (1). Following my work on amino acid sequences in proteins (2) I turned my attention to RNA and, with G.G. Brownlee and B.G. Barrell, developed a relatively rapid small-scale method for the fractionation of P-labelled oligonucleotides (3). This became the basis for most subsequent studies of RNA sequences. The general approach used in these studies, and in those on proteins, depended on the principle of partial degradation. The large molecules were broken down, usually by suitable enzymes, to give smaller products which were then separated from each other and their sequence determined. When sufficient results had been obtained they were fitted together by a process of deduction to give the complete sequence. This approach was necessarily rather slow and tedious, often involving successive digestions and fractionations, and it was not easy to apply it to the larger DNA molecules. When we first studied DNA some significant sequences of about 50 nucleotides in length were obtained with this method (4,5), but it seemed that to be able to sequence genetic material a new approach was desirable and we turned our attention to the use of copying procedures.",1981,26,345,2,0,1,4,11,7,7,10,23,19,21

Excimer lasers and various microwave discharge lamps were used as light sources. Emissions from aerosols excited by excimer laser photons were dispersed. The emission spectrum shows molecular structure. The emission intensity is closely correlated with the aerosol scattering intensity, indicating that the emission is produced from the optical excitation of aerosols. The excitation functions for producing the aerosol scattering and emission light were investigated at various excitation wavelengths, O 3 and 1-C 4 H 8 concentrations and reaction times. The aerosol formation process is speculated in accord with the data of aerosol scattering and emission light intensities.

There are limited data about the prognostic factors predicting outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers for the elderly. Here, we evaluated outcomes in elderly patients in a real-world setting.


METHODS
Between April 2015 and January 2017, 80 patients with anterior intracranial acute large vessel occlusion, who had lived independently before ictus, were treated with mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever at our institute. We compared outcomes between patients ≥80 years old (n = 36) and those <80 years old (n = 44), and assessed prognostic factors for favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) at 90 days in all patients.


RESULTS
There was no significant difference in baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score between the 2 groups. Successful revascularization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [mTICI] scores 2b/3) (83% versus 93%, P = .286), complete recanalization (mTICI 3) (47% versus 50%, P = .826), and favorable outcomes (42% versus 57%, P = .261) were achieved more often in those <80 years old, but differences did not reach statistical significance. Multivariate regression analysis showed that baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (P = .013) and mTICI scores of 3 (P = .006) were significant predictive factors, but being ≥80 years old and baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score were not. In those ≥80 years old, mTICI score of 3 was an influential factor for favorable outcome (P = .017).


CONCLUSIONS
Being aged 80 years or older was not a significant predictor for outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy, whereas complete recanalization was an influential predictor of outcome in the elderly.",2017,11,28,0,0,6,5,11,6,0,0,0,0,0

Zodiacal emission,"The Planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps spanning nine frequencies from 30 GHz to 857 GHz, with an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and angular resolution. Planets, minor bodies, and di use interplanetary dust (IPD) contribute to the submillimetre and millimetre sky emission it observed. The di use emission can be e ectively separated from Galactic and other emissions, because Planck views a given point on the distant celestial sphere multiple times, through di erent columns of IPD. We use the Planck data to investigate the behaviour of Zodiacal emission over the whole sky in the sub-millimetre and millimetre. We fit the COBE Zodiacal model to the Planck data to find the emissivities of the various components of this model ‐ a di use cloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an Earth-trailing feature. The emissivity of the di use Zodiacal cloud decreases with increasing wavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. The emissivities of the dust bands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of the grains in the bands are di erent than those in the di use cloud. As part of the analysis, we fit the small amount of Galactic emission seen through the instrument’s far sidelobes and place limits on possible contamination of the CMB results from both Zodiacal emission and Galactic emission seen through these far sidelobes. When necessary, these results are used in the Planck pipeline to make maps with Zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed. We show that the spectrum of the Zodiacal correction to the CMB maps is small compared to the Planck CMB temperature power spectrum.",2013,85,104,0,35,12,14,10,7,3,5,17,1,0

The present results lead to a general bonding model for three-membered ring systems. Composition of the MO's, population analyses and electron density distribution diagrams were used to establish the nature of the bonding. The total electron density distributions in cyclopropane and in cyclopropene lead to a “bent bond” + “central hole” bonding model; however the bending angle is only ca. 5° and the central hole is not very deep with respect to the bonding regions (ca. 15% density depression). Special emphasis has been given to the nature of the σ bonds forming the ring system. It has been found that the ring bonding in cyclopropane and in cyclopropene is due principally to three MO's: (1) A low lying MO (3a1) composed mainly of C(2s) AO's and contributing electron density principally inside the ring triangle. (2) Two MO's (6a1 and 3b2), which are the highest occupied MO's in cyclopropane and lie immediately below the π bond in cyclopropene, composed almost exclusively of C(2p) AO's in the ring plane and leading to electron density maxima outside the ring (density bending angle of ca. 20°) and to zero density in the centre of the ring. In the case of diazirine these MO's are appreciably perturbed by the presence of the nitrogen lone pairs. Three MO's contribute mainly to the description of the lone pairs, all of which also contribute to some extent to ring bonding. Furthermore, among these three MO's two lie below the π level, one of them being very low in energy. This is quite different from the usual picture. The present bonding picture has been compared to former semi-empirical models (especially the Coulson-Moffitt and the Walsh models). The strain, the “π” character and conjugative properties of the three-membered ring are discussed on the basis of its electronic structure. The special bonding features of this system confer on it a pseudo-π(ψ-π) character; the bonds making up the ring may be considered as ψ-π bonds.ZusammenfassungDie Elektronenstruktur von Cyclopropan, Cyclopropen und Diazirin wurde im Rahmen einer ab initio SCF-LCAO-MO-Methode untersucht. Die Untersuchungen führen zu einem allgemeinen Bindungsmodell für Dreierringe. Der Aufbau der MO's, Populationsanalyse und die Elektronendichte-Verteilungen wurden zur Bestimmung der Bindungsart herangezogen. Die Gesamtelektronendichte-Verteilungen in Cyclopropan und Cyclopropen führen zu einem Bindungsmodell aus „gebogener Bindung“ und „Ringloch“, jedoch ist der Bindungswinkel nur ca. 5° und das Ringloch ist nicht sehr tief (ca. 15% Dichteverringerung). Besonderes Augenmerk wurde auf die σ-Bindungen, die das Ring-system bilden gelegt. Dabei wurde festgestellt, daß die Ringbindung in Cyclopropan und Cyclopropen hauptsächlich auf drei MO's beruht: einem niedrig liegenden MO (3a1) das im wesentlichen aus C (2s) AO's besteht und vor allein die Elektronendichte innerhalb des Rings liefert, zwei MO's (6a1 und 3b2), die die höchstens besetzten MO's in Cyclopropan sind und bei Cyclopropen direkt unterhalb der π-Bindung liegt. Sie setzten sich nahezu nur aus C(2p) AO's in der Ringebene zusammen und führen zu einem Dichtemaxima außerhalb des Rings (mit einem Winkel von ca. 20°) und zu einer verschwindenden Dichte im Ringzentrum. Im Fall des Diazirin sind diese MO's durch das einsame Elektronenpaar des Stickstoffs gestört. Drei MO's tragen zu der Beschreibung der einsamen Elektronenpaare bei, die auch alle in gewissem Maß zur Ringbindung beitragen. Darüber hinaus liegen zwei davon unter dem π-Niveau, eines ist energetisch sehr niedrig, im Gegensatz zum üblichen Bild. Das hier diskutierte Bindungsmodell wurde mit früheren semiempirischen Modellen verglichen (insbesondere den Modellen von Coulson-Moffitt und von Walsh). Die Spannung, der π-Charakter und die Eigenschaften der Konjugation der Dreierringe werden auf Grund der Elektronenstruktur diskutiert. Die besonderen Bindungseigenschaften sprechen für einen pseudo-π-Charakter (ψ-π), die Ringbindungen konnen als ψ-π-Bindungen betrachtet werden.RésuméLa structure électronique du cyclopropane, du cyclopropane et de la diazirine a été étudiée dans le cadre théorique ab initio SCF-LCAO-MO. Les résultats obtenus fournissent un modèle de liaison pour les cycles à trois chaînons. La nature des liaisons a été étudiée à l'aide des OM, des analyses de population et de diagrammes de densité électronique. La distribution des densités électroniques totales conduit à un modèle «liaison courbe» + «cavité centrale» cependant l'angle de courbure n'est que de 5° et la cavité centrale n'est pas très profonde par rapport aux liaisons (dépression d'environ 15%). La nature des liaisons formant le cycle a été considérée tout spécialement. Trois OM contribuent principalement aux liaisons du cycle: (1) Une OM basse en énergie (3a1), formée principalement d'OA C(2s) et fournissant de la densité électronique principalement à l'intérieur du triangle. (2) Deux OM (6a1 et 3b2), les deux OM de plus haute énergie dans le cyclopropane et celles situées immédiatement en dessous de l'orbitale n dans le cyclopropène, formées presque exclusivement d'OA C(2p) dans le plan du cycle, et présentant leur maximum de densité électronique à l'extérieur du cycle (angle de courbure des densités d'environ 20°) et une densité nulle au centre du cycle. Dans le cas de la diazirine ces OM sont fortement perturbées par la présence des doublets libres de l'azote. Trois OM contribuent principalement à la description des doublets libres, tout en participant plus ou moins à des liaisons du cycle. Deux de ces OM sont d'énergie inférieure à la liaisin n, l'une des deux est tout spécialement basse en énergie. Ce résultat diffère notablement de l'idée que l'on se fait ordinairement de la nature des doublets libres. Le modèle de liaison obtenu dans ce travail est comparé à des modèles semi-empiriques antérieurs (principalement les modèles de Coulson-Moffitt et de Walsh). La tension, le caractère “π” et l'aptitude à la conjugaison du cycle à trois chaînons sont discutées à l'aide de sa structure électronique. Les caractères particuliers des liaisons dans ce système lui confèrent un caractère pseudo-π(ψ-π), les liaisons du cycle pouvant être considérées comme des liaisons ψ-π.",1969,38,31,0,0,2,2,2,4,0,0,1,1,0

Atherosclerosis is enhanced in arterial segments exposed to disturbed flow. Perturbed shear stress increases the expression of oxidation-sensitive responsive genes (such as ELK-1 and p-CREB). Polyphenolic antioxidants contained in the juice derived from the pomegranate contribute to the reduction of oxidative stress and atherogenesis during disturbed shear stress.


AIM OF THE STUDY
To evaluate the effects of intervention with the Pomegranate Fruit Extract (PFE) rich in polyphones (punicalagin, which is a potent antioxidant) on ELK-1, p-CREB, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression induced by high shear stress in vitro and in vivo.


RESULTS
At the doses used in the study, both the PFE and the regular pomegranate juice concentrate reduced the activation of ELK-1 and p-CREB and increased eNOS expression (which was decreased by perturbed shear stress) in cultured human endothelial cells and in atherosclerosis-prone areas of hypercholesterolemic mice. PFE and pomegranate juice increased cyclic GMP levels while there was no significant effect of both compounds on the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Administration of these compounds to hypercholesterolemic mice significantly reduced the progression of atherosclerosis and isoprostane levels and increased nitrates. This protective effect was relevant with PFE. Vasomotor reactivity was improved and EC(25) values in response to Ach and NONOate were significantly increased in treated mice in comparison to controls.


CONCLUSION
This study indicates that the proatherogenic effects induced by perturbed shear stress can be also reversed by chronic administration of PFE.",2007,61,100,1,6,7,7,6,8,12,10,6,4,5

Molecular cloning and assignment of biochemical function to PtlI, a cytochrome P450 of Streptomyces avermitilis.","A gene cluster encoding all of the enzymes for the biosynthesis of the antibiotic pentalenolactone (1) has recently been identified in Streptomyces avermitilis. The biosynthetic gene cluster contains the ptlI (SAV2999) gene which encodes a cytochrome P450 (CYP183A1). PtlI was cloned by PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal His6-tag protein. Recombinant PtlI bound pentalenene (3) with high affinity (KD = 1.44 +/- 0.14 muM). Incubation of recombinant PtlI with (+/-)-3 in the presence of NADPH, E. coli flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase, and O2 resulted in conversion to a single enantiomer of pentalen-13-al (7), by stepwise allylic oxidation via pentalen-13-ol (6).

In this study we present evidence that the primary interference effects of dsRNA are post-transcriptional. First, we examined the primary DNA sequence after dsRNA-mediated interference and found no evidence for alterations. Second, we found that dsRNA-mediated interference with the upstream gene in a polar operon had no effect on the activity of the downstream gene; this finding argues against an effect on initiation or elongation of transcription. Third, we observed by in situ hybridization that dsRNA-mediated interference produced a substantial, although not complete, reduction in accumulation of nascent transcripts in the nucleus, while cytoplasmic accumulation of transcripts was virtually eliminated. These results indicate that the endogenous mRNA is the target for interference and suggest a mechanism that degrades the targeted RNA before translation can occur. This mechanism is not dependent on the SMG system, an mRNA surveillance system in C. elegans responsible for targeting and destroying aberrant messages. We suggest a model of how dsRNA might function in a catalytic mechanism to target homologous mRNAs for degradation.",1998,38,630,15,1,24,64,43,49,48,48,43,38,25

Four ten-trial training sessions, with 1�-hour intersession intervals, produced habituation that was retained for more than 1 week. This 5-hour procedure could be applied to a test system in the isolated abdominal ganglion where the cellular changes accompanying the acquisition of long-term habituation can be examined. During acquisition, intracellular recordings were obtained from L7, a major gill and siphon motor neuron, and the pattern of stimulation used in the behavioral experiments was applied to an afferent nerve. Acquisition was associated with a progressive decrease in the complex excitatory synaptic potential produced in L7 by afferent nerve stimulation. When retention was tested 24 hours later, the synaptic decrement was still evident. Thus, a behaviorally meaningful stimulus sequence, consisting of only 40 patterned stimuli, leads to changes in synaptic effectiveness lasting one or more days in a neural pathway involved in short-term habituation of this reflex.",1973,11,99,3,0,3,1,0,3,4,1,2,3,1

Patients in the complementation group E (XP-E) have the mildest form of the disease and the highest level of residual repair activity. About 20% of the cell strains derived from XP-E patients lack a damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB) activity that binds to ultraviolet-induced (6-4) photoproducts with high affinity. We report here that cell-free extracts prepared from XP-E cell strains that either lacked or contained DDB activity were severely defective in excising DNA damage including (6-4) photoproducts. However, this excision activity defect was not restored by addition of purified DDB that, in fact, inhibited removal of (6-4) photoproducts by the human excision nuclease reconstituted from purified proteins. Extensive purification of correcting activity from HeLa cells revealed that the correcting activity is inseparable from the human replication/repair protein A [RPA (also known as human single stranded DNA binding protein, HSSB)]. Indeed, supplementing XP-E extracts with recombinant human RPA purified from Escherichia coli restored excision activity. However, no mutation was found in the genes encoding the three subunits of RPA in an XP-E (DDB-) cell line. It is concluded that RPA functionally complements XP-E extracts in vitro, but it is not genetically altered in XP-E patients.",1996,3,75,3,1,8,9,11,9,6,5,5,6,5

Hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species, oxidizes peroxisomal proteins and membrane lipids, resulting in a decrease in peroxisomal quality. We demonstrate that the autophagic system is responsible for the elimination of oxidized peroxisomes in plant. We isolated Arabidopsis mutants that accumulated oxidized peroxisomes, which formed large aggregates. We revealed that these mutants were defective in autophagy-related (ATG) genes and that the aggregated peroxisomes were selectively targeted by the autophagic machinery. These findings suggest that autophagy plays an important role in the quality control of peroxisomes by the selective degradation of oxidized peroxisomes. In addition, the results suggest that autophagy is also responsible for the functional transition of glyoxysomes to leaf peroxisomes.",2014,0,11,0,0,1,5,0,1,3,0,1,0,0

Both the carboxylate ligand and the aryl group of the N-heterocyclic carbene have been altered and the resulting catalysts evaluated using a range of metathesis reactions. Substitution of bidentate with monodentate X-type ligands led to a severe attenuation of metathesis activity and selectivity, while minor differences were observed between bidentate ligands within the same family (e.g., carboxylates). The use of nitrato-type ligands in place of carboxylates afforded a significant improvement in metathesis activity and selectivity. With these catalysts, turnover numbers approaching 1000 were possible for a variety of cross-metathesis reactions, including the synthesis of industrially relevant products.",2012,66,299,0,27,43,61,32,30,27,17,17,20,19

In an inhomogeneous laser beam, the energies of the dressed states vary in space, and this gives rise to dressed-state-dependent forces. Spontaneous transitions between dressed states lead to a multivalued instantaneous force fluctuating around a mean value. The velocity dependence of the mean force is related to the modification, induced by the atomic motion, of the population balance between the different dressed states. The corresponding modification of the atomic energy is associated with a change of the fluorescence spectrum emitted by the atom. The particular case of atomic motion in a standing wave is investigated, and two regimes are identified in which the mean dipole force averaged over a wavelength exhibits a simple velocity dependence. The large values of this force achievable with reasonable laser powers are pointed out with view to slowing down atoms with dipole",1985,37,415,6,1,1,4,7,15,9,11,14,4,12

We also develop a simple model to disentangle intrinsic color variations and reddening by dust and expand the method to incorporate U-band light curves and to more easily accommodate prior constraints on any of the model parameters. We apply this method to 133 nearby SNe Ia, including 95 objects in the Hubble flow (cz ≥ 2500 km s-1), which give an intrinsic dispersion of less than 7% in distance. The Hubble flow sample, which is of critical importance to all cosmological uses of SNe Ia, is the largest ever presented with homogeneous distances. We find that the Hubble flow SNe with H0dSN ≥ 7400 km s-1 yield an expansion rate that is 6.5% ± 1.8% lower than the rate determined from SNe within that distance, and this can have a large effect on measurements of the dark energy equation of state with SNe Ia. Peculiar velocities of SN Ia host galaxies in the rest frame of the Local Group are consistent with the dipole measured in the cosmic microwave background. Direct fits of SNe Ia that are significantly reddened by dust in their host galaxies suggest that their mean extinction law may be described by RV 2.7, but optical colors alone provide weak constraints on RV.",2006,104,538,85,0,42,40,46,48,42,63,40,35,30

Four distinct domains had additive effects on efficient transcription from the EIV promoter in HeLa whole-cell extracts. The first resided 20 to 27 bases upstream of the initiation site and included the TATA box. Deletion of the TATA box drastically reduced the transcriptional activity in vitro but had a lesser effect in vivo. The second region extended from -32 to -177 and contained two 17-base-pair inverted repeats, centered around -40 and -162. Sequences lying between -140 and -173 were important for efficient transcription since deletion of this region reduced the activity fourfold. Deletion of either one of the two inverted repeats or insertion of DNA fragments between them resulted in the synthesis of extra transcripts that initiated at sites upstream from the EIV site. The third region was located between -198 and -250 and contains three guanosine-plus-cytosine-rich sequences, present around -212 (GGGCGG), -233 (GGGCGG), and -251 (CGCGGG). The fourth, most upstream region was located between -260 and -307. Deletion of this region, which contains the NF-1 factor-binding site, slightly reduced transcriptional activity both in vivo and in vitro.

Antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) signaled early graft rejection (median survival congruent to two months), whereas hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) signaled delayed rejection (greater than 22 months). Patients with neither HBsAg nor anti-HBs had graft survival times (median congruent to 16 months) similar to the HBsAg carriers but significantly longer than the anti-HBs-positive patients (p less than 0.01). Similar results were observed when patients who received HLA-identical kidneys or had anti-HLA antibodies before transplantation were excluded. The highest probability of graft rejection was in patients with anti-HBs who received kidneys from male donors.

Materials and methods: We carried out a prospective, randomized, double‐blind, controlled, passive immunotherapy study, which compared two groups. One received plasma rich in HIV antibodies, the other a standard seronegative plasma. Results: Measurement of the plasma HIV RNA load showed in both groups a significant decrease in the mean viral copy number at the end of the first month, followed by an increase at the third month. Beyond the third month, a significant decrease in viral load was observed only in the treatment group. A significant difference in favor of the treatment group was observed for plasma viremia by HIV culture. For the cytokines involved in the viral replication and for the immune activation markers such as neopterin and β2‐microglobulin, the biological analysis in plasma failed to show a significant difference in either group. Clinically, the treatment group benefited by delay in the appearance of the first AIDS‐defining event and reduction in the cumulative incidence of such events.

63016c32611a9a589eabc2371afa52d0b9a6824f,Topography of Head Direction Cells in Medial Entorhinal Cortex,"BACKGROUND
Neural circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) support translation of the external environment to an internal map of space, with grid and head direction neurons providing metrics for distance and orientation.


RESULTS
We show here that head direction cells in MEC are organized topographically. Head direction tuning varies widely across the entire dorsoventral MEC axis, but in layer III there is a gradual dorsal-to-ventral increase in the average width of the directional firing field. Sharply tuned cells were encountered only at the dorsal end of MEC. Similar topography was not observed among head direction cells in layers V-VI. At all MEC locations, in all layers, the preferred firing direction (directional phase) showed a uniform distribution. The continuity of the dorsoventral tuning gradient coexisted with discrete topography in the spatial scale of simultaneously recorded grid cells.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings point to dorsoventral gradients as a fundamental property of entorhinal circuits, upon which modular organization may be expressed in select subpopulations.",2014,57,98,8,7,10,16,14,11,13,14,12,0,0

During the first few days of the disease, there is a marked increase in liver lysosome fragility and a sharp elevation in plasma β-glucuronidase and acid phosphatase. Commencing on day 4, both liver lysosome fragility and plasma levels of acid hydrolases decrease. Liver lysosome fragility and plasma acid hydrolases again increase on day 9 and continue to rise. Between days 4 and 9, when liver lysosomes appear to be stabilized and plasma levels of acid hydrolases are near control values, the onset of erythrocyte membrane stabilization occurs which endures throughout the disease. Acid phosphatase activity in the injected hind paw increases immediately after induction of polyarthritis as does the swelling, whereas enzyme activity in and swelling of the contralateral hind paw increase 9 or 10 days later.

d5c759593dcffaba5e6df3a62e946c3efa47481a,"Regulating S Phase: CDKs, Licensing and Proteolysis","The above model explains how reformation of initiation complexes is prevented by CDK activity. However, it does not explain how activated replication complexes bound to the DNA are inactivated once they have completed replication. Although the ORC proteins themselves remain constant in level during the cell cycle, the Cdc6/cdc18 class of protein drops in level towards the end of S-phase. This drop in protein level may explain why mutants altered in genes involved in proteolysis have recently been implicated in the control preventing re-replication of DNA (Heichman and Roberts 1996xHeichman, K. and Roberts, J.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 39–48Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (74)See all ReferencesHeichman and Roberts 1996).In a screen for budding yeast mutants that accumulate excess DNA, temperature sensitive mutants were isolated that accumulate a greater than normal DNA content. Two of these mutants proved to be alleles of CDC16 and CDC27, which encode proteins making up the complex involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (reviewed inMurray 1995xMurray, A. Cell. 1995; 81: 149–152Abstract | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (252)See all ReferencesMurray 1995). This is a multi-step process resulting in ubiquitination of the protein substrate targeting it for degradation by the proteasome complex. Although ubiquitination is important in the degradation of many proteins, it is also involved more specifically in the degradation of key cell cycle proteins. It has been clearly implicated in the exit of mitosis, both for degradation of the G2/M CDK and of molecules postulated to hold sister chromatids together (see Murray, 1995 for references).Rereplication occurs in the cdc16ts and cdc27ts mutant cells without them passing through the early G1 control start. If re-replication is due to a defect in proteolysis, then the most obvious target protein would be a replication factor that needs to be inactivated after the initiation of S-phase. One candidate target would be the Cdc6/cdc18 class of proteins, since they play a key role in initiation and are proteolysed at the end of S-phase. If this view is correct, then either overexpressing cdc18 or defects in the proteolytic machinery could have similar effects, because they both could lead to high levels of the Cdc6/cdc18 class of protein. It is possible that CDK phosphorylation of the Cdc6/cdc18 class of protein could target them for proteolysis. Another possibility is that in the absence of the proteolytic machinery the Cdc6/cdc18 proteins do not become dissociated from the ORC when two replication forks meet, leaving competent replication complexes which can continue replication. This could explain why replication can continue in the presence of high CLB associated CDK activity: if this CDK activity only blocks reassociation of proteins with origins, then high CDK activity would have little effect on proteins that have remained associated with origins. These proteins could remain associated with origins if proteolysis is defective, explaining the continued DNA synthesis. It is also possible that high CDK activity could have an additional role in preventing the accumulation of the Cdc6/cdc18 class of protein by repressing transcription.Much remains to be tested to link the CDK cycle with changes in proteolysis during the cell cycle. For example, is the proteolytic machinery degrading proteins at the end of mitosis similar to that acting at S-phase, or is specificity introduced by particular components of the machinery? However, it is clear that changes both in CDK phosphorylation and in proteolysis are important for cell cycle progression. Exit from mitosis requires both CDK inactivation and activation of specific proteolysis, whilst entry into S-phase requires initially CDK inactivation followed by CDK activation. From the work reviewed here it seems likely that exit from S-phase will require both continued CDK activity and further specific proteolysis. The process of phosphorylation and proteolysis both provide rapid mechanisms for changing the state of a cell. Phosphorylation changes are reversible allowing protein substrates to be conserved which makes this an economical process. Specific proteolysis is obviously more wasteful but if it is confined to just a few key substrates, it has the advantage of providing a very definite on/off switch. There may be control advantages to the cell in using a combination of both mechanisms. Changes in phosphorylation would provide an economical control which could regulate many of the components involved, whilst specific proteolysis of key components would provide an irreversible commitment to beginning or ending a process. It seems likely that the overall control of S-phase is going to involve changes in both CDK dependent phosphorylation and cell cycle specific proteolysis. Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of DNA replication should illuminate more specifically how both phosphorylation and proteolysis bring about their regulatory effects over S-phase.",1996,39,115,2,7,22,18,12,9,8,9,3,6,4

The photocurrent measured under steady state conditions is 20 times larger in the higher molecular weight polymer (HM{sub n} Si-PDTBT). Different decays of polarization memory in transient photoinduced spectroscopy measurements are consistent with more mobile photoexcitations in HM{sub n} Si-PDTBT relative to the lower molecular weight counterpart (LM{sub n} Si-PDTBT). Analysis of the current-voltage characteristics of field effect transistors reveals an increase in the mobility by a factor of 700 for HM{sub n} Si-PDTBT. Near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements demonstrate that LM{sub n} Si-PDTBT forms a disordered morphology throughout the depth of the film, whereas HM{sub n} Si-PDTBT exhibits pronounced {pi}-{pi} stacking in an edge-on configuration near the substrate interface. Increased interchain overlap between polymers in the edge-on configuration in HM{sub n} Si-PDTBT results in the higher carrier mobility.

03453be3ec7ded1e603843e35a893f8b443105fb,"Epigenomics: A Roadmap, But to Where?","Recently, the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) allocated $190 million for an “Epigenomics” Roadmap initiative ([1][1]). As investigators in this area, we endorse the idea that chromatin biology is an appropriate, if not essential, area for the NIH to support, not only for its fundamental biological significance but also its relevance to human disease. Nonetheless, we believe that this initiative, at least in its current form, will not yield significant benefits. If the use of the term “epigenome” is intended to equate the value of this Roadmap initiative with the Human Genome Project, it fails on several grounds.

First, it does not consider our current understanding of the roles of sequence-specific DNA recognition events and transcriptional networks in controlling epigenetic changes. A multifaceted effort that elucidates transcriptional circuits that tell us where and when signal-responsive, sequence-specific regulators function would be more useful for understanding cell type programming. Second, merely cataloging modification patterns offers comparatively little new or useful information. We already know that most genes are associated with one of a few patterns of chromatin modifications and that the patterns themselves do not tell us how that gene is regulated or how its expression state is inherited. Most histone modifications are highly dynamic and change rapidly in response to changes in signals that turn genes on or off.

This initiative will divert substantial resources, enough to fund 200 multiyear individual grants. There is a notion favored by some that individual scientists need to be corralled to work together under a more rigid, directed framework to solve important problems. We disagree. Real innovation comes from the bottom up, and good science policy requires promoting the free market of ideas rather than central planning ([2][2]).

The behavior of excited chlorophyll molecules at single crystal ZnO‐electrodes has been investigated. These molecules inject electrons from excited levels into the conduction band of the electrode, thus giving rise to an anodic photocurrent. The influence of various agents on this electron transfer has been studied. In the presence of suitable electron donors (e.g., hydroquinone, phenylhydrazine) in the electrolyte chlorophyll molecules, absorbing quanta, mediate the pumping of electrons from levels of the reducing agents into the conduction band of the semiconductor‐electron acceptor. The electron capture by the semiconductor electrode is irreversible, when an adequate electrochemical gradient is provided in the electrode surface. Some properties of excited chlorophyll at semiconductor electrodes (unidirectional electron transfer, highly efficient charge separation, chlorophyll as electron pump and able to convert electronic excitation into electric energy) show similarity to the behavior of chlorophyll in photosynthetic reaction centers.",1971,14,163,0,1,2,1,2,5,5,5,9,3,4

Since guanine nucleotides regulate the binding affinity and transductional activity of several other types of receptors, we examined the effect of nucleotides on the binding of N-formyl-methionyl peptides to their receptors on human PMN membranes. The addition of guanylylimidodiphosphate (0.1 mM), a nonhydrolyzable derivative of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), to PMN membrane preparations reduced the fraction of high-affinity receptors detected in equilibrium binding studies from 21.3 +/- 0.13 to 11.8 +/- 0.05% (P less than 0.03), without altering the binding affinities. Since the total number of receptors remained unchanged, the effect of guanylylimidodiphosphate was to convert a portion of the receptors from the high-affinity state to the low-affinity state. At the maximal concentration of guanine nucleotide tested, approximately 50% of the high-affinity sites were converted to low-affinity sites. The findings obtained by equilibrium binding were supported by kinetic studies since the dissociation of the radiolabeled oligopeptide chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-[3H]phenylalanine from PMN membranes was accelerated in the presence of guanine nucleotide. The effect of guanine nucleotides was reversed upon washing, indicating that affinity conversion is bidirectional. The guanine nucleotide effects were greatest with nonhydrolyzable derivatives of GTP followed by GTP then guanosine diphosphate. Neither guanosine monophosphate nor any adenine nucleotide tested had an effect on receptor binding. These data suggest a role for guanine nucleotides in the regulation of stimulus-receptor coupling of chemoattractant receptors on human PMN.",1983,15,170,0,0,8,13,17,22,14,11,15,12,12

46fa4284b2c4396e8680708fc466bbd4bbc895de,Thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction: Part I.,"Thrombolytic therapy with pharmacologic agents is an exciting approach to the treatment of myocardial infarction. The results of several clinical studies indicate that perfusion can be restored with intravenous therapy and may be associated with a reduction in infarct size and improved left ventricular function. In a trial involving more than 11,000 patients, thrombolytic therapy reduced acute and long term mortality. Pharmacologic thrombolysis, however, is not without problems. When administered intravenously, the agents currently available, streptokinase and urokinase, are associated with a relatively low recanalization rate as well as a risk of adverse effects, most commonly a systemic lytic state and risk of bleeding complications. Although intracoronary administration is associated with a higher rate of recanalization, the need for cardiac catheterization limits its applicability and results in a delay in the initiation of thrombolytic therapy (which diminishes salvage of myocardium). The trials assessing the existing agents have shown that time is a critical variable in the success of thrombolytic therapy. This had led investigators to focus more attention on intravenous agents that can be administered rapidly. The newer agents now under investigation, acylated streptokinase and single-chain urokinase, may represent improvements of currently available products and may offer potentially increased benefits. A fibrinogen-sparing agent, such as t-PA, in addition to being highly effective, may offer advantages through minimizing the systemic lytic effect. Additional randomized, controlled clinical trials currently are underway to determine the effect on mortality of this ""fibrinolytic"" therapy as part of a total treatment regimen. The current status of our knowledge concerning thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction can be summarized as follows: 1. Transmural (that is, Q wave) myocardial infarction usually is caused by an obstructing coronary thrombus. 2. The thrombus can be lysed with intravenous therapy in the majority of cases, particularly with newer, well-tolerated fibrin-specific agents. 3. There is considerable evidence suggesting that reperfusion reduces the acute morbidity and mortality when therapy is administered successfully within the initial 3 to 4 hours (and possibly up to 6 hours) after onset of symptoms. 4. Data on long term prognosis after thrombolysis are very encouraging, although limited. 5. Conventional agents lead to significant fibrinogen depletion and therefore an increased risk of bleeding; the new fibrin-selected agents cause less fibrinogen degradation and may reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1988,55,13,0,0,1,1,3,1,0,0,1,0,0

Interestingly, mice that received mixtures of whole lymph node or purified CD4+ cells with CD4+/CD45RBhi cells did not develop weight loss, indicating that the unseparated CD4+ population contained cells that were capable of regulating the reactivity of the CD4+/CD45RBhi cells.",1993,39,483,7,3,9,13,13,11,21,27,30,21,28

The work recorded here compares by both methods the MSH activity of 10 stereoisomeric pentapeptide fragments of MSH and 8 synthetic peptides related to ACTH. The MSH activity of most of the stereoisomers appeared greater in vivo than in vitro. When, these compounds were assayed at various time intervals, some of the pentapeptides revealed differences which may help partially to explain this discrepancy in activity between the two methods. These differences may also help in understanding the alterations of α-MSH induced by sodium hydroxide1,2.

The primary structures of peptides 3 and 4 were based upon a previously studied heptapeptide (2), which was shown to adopt a predominantly 3(10)-helical conformation in CDCl(3) solution and an alpha-helical conformation in the solid state. Circular dichroism, IR, and solution-phase (1)H NMR studies strongly suggested that acyclic precursors 3 and 4 and the fully saturated macrocyclic products 7 and 8 also adopted helical conformations in apolar organic solvents. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction of cyclic peptide 8 showed it to exist as a right-handed 3(10)-helix up to the fifth residue. Solution-phase NMR structures of both acyclic peptide 4 and cyclic peptide 8 in CD(2)Cl(2) indicated that the acyclic diene assumes a loosely 3(10)-helical conformation, which is considerably rigidified upon macrocyclization. The relative ease of introducing carbon-carbon bonds into peptide secondary structures by RCM and the predicted metabolic stability of these bonds renders olefin metathesis an exceptional methodology for the synthesis of rigidified peptide architectures.",2001,0,186,0,2,4,7,5,6,2,4,6,11,10

6240443828fae1ea7986fe9403a60d4946ef7bf4,Neural and endocrine mechanisms underlying stress-induced suppression of pulsatile LH secretion,"Stress is well-known to inhibit a variety of reproductive processes, including the suppression of episodic Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, typically measured via downstream luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. Since pulsatile secretion of GnRH and LH are necessary for proper reproductive function in both males and females, and stress is common for both human and animals, understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which stress impairs LH pulses is of critical importance. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and its corresponding endocrine factors, is a key feature of the stress response, so dissecting the role of stress hormones, including corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and corticosterone, in the inhibition of LH secretion has been one key research focus. However, some evidence suggests that stress hormone alone are not sufficient for the full inhibition of LH caused by stress, implicating the additional involvement of other hormonal or neural signaling pathways in this process (including inputs from the brainstem, amygdala, parabrachial nucleus, and dorsomedial nucleus). Moreover, different stress types, such as metabolic stress (hypoglycemia), immune stress, and psychosocial stress, appear to suppress LH secretion via partially unique neural and endocrine pathways. The mechanisms underlying the suppression of LH pulses in these models offer interesting comparisons and contrasts, including the specific roles of amygdaloid nuclei and CRH receptor types. This review focuses on the most recent and emerging insights into endocrine and neural mechanisms responsible for the suppression of pulsatile LH secretion in mammals, and offers insights in important gaps in knowledge and future directions.",2019,115,12,0,1,6,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, while prostacyclin induced near‐maximal inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation, NP or GTN had no effect. 3 Ex vivo, NP caused a significant decrease in ECLT and an increase in plasma t‐PA activity. 4 Intravenous co‐administration of t‐PA (30 μg kg−1) with NP caused substantial prolongation of plasma t‐PA activity, without affecting t‐PA antigen levels. 5 In whole blood in vitro, NP (30 μg kg−1) prevented the time‐dependent increase in PAI‐1 activity and inhibited inactivation of added t‐PA (10 ng ml−1). 6 We propose that NP exhibited fibrinolytic activity through increased t‐PA activity as a result of inhibition of PAI‐1 release from platelets.

In this model, we investigated inhibitory effects of the modern luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LH-RH) antagonist SB-75 and the agonist D-Trp6-LH-RH. The analogs were administered in the form of sustained delivery systems (microcapsules and microgranules). In the first experiment, treatment lasted 10 weeks. After 9 weeks of treatment, a significant inhibition of tumor volume was first found only in the group treated with SB-75, but the final tumor volume was significantly suppressed both by D-Trp6-LH-RH and SB-75. In the second experiment, treatment was started 70 days after tumor transplantation and was continued for 6 weeks. Chronic treatment with SB-75 or D-Trp6-LH-RH appeared to completely arrest tumor growth as measured by tumor volume, percentage change in tumor volume, and tumor weight. Serum estradiol was suppressed to undetectable levels and LH levels were also diminished. Histologically, the regressive changes in the treated tumors were due to the enhancement of apoptosis (programmed cell death) of tumor cells. Membrane receptor assays showed that LH-RH binding sites were down-regulated in tumor cells after treatment with SB-75 or D-Trp6-LH-RH.The results indicate that the antagonist SB-75, released from sustained delivery systems, can inhibit the growth of MCF-7 MIII tumors as effectively as the agonist D-Trp6-LH-RH, but more rapidly. In view of its immediate blockade of the pituitary-gonadal axis and the absence of side effects, the LH-RH antagonist SB-75 might be considered as a possible new hormonal agent for the treatment of breast cancer.",1992,53,18,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

The enzymatic method was, therefore, compared with the widely used o-cresolphthalein complexone (o-CPC) method and methylxylenol blue (MXB) method, the colorimetry of Ca complexes with chelating agents. The dose-response curve of the oCPC method and MXB methods appeared to be sigmoid, with the measurable range of Ca being 0-30 mg/dl and 0-15mg/dl, respectively; that of the enzymatic method was rectilinear with a measurable range of 050mg/dl. The coefficients of variation (CV) of reproducibility (n = 10) were 0.89% in the o-CPC method, 0.73% in the MXB method, and 1.0% in the enzymatic method. On addition of magnesium (Mg, 60mg/dl) to the samples, however, CV of reproducibility rose to 7.19%, 5.32%, and 1.70%, respectively, especially by the colorimetric methods. In 143 urine samples, the CV of Ca content between o-CPC (X) and enzymatic (Y) methods was 0.999 with a regression line of Y-0.85X + 2.53 (2-15.27mg/dl, ~p = 15.50mg/dl).

Ca concentration obtained by the o-CPC method was about 4% higher than by Other methods, because some of the coexisting Mg was measured as Ca by this method as the result of insufficient specificity.

It belongs to the group of familial frontotemporal dementias with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), a major class of inherited dementing disorders whose genetic basis is unknown. We now report a G to A transition in the intron following exon 10 of the gene for microtubule-associated protein tau in familial MSTD. The mutation is located at the 3' neighboring nucleotide of the GT splice-donor site and disrupts a predicted stem-loop structure. We also report an abnormal preponderance of soluble tau protein isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeats over isoforms with three repeats in familial MSTD. This most likely accounts for our previous finding that sarkosyl-insoluble tau protein extracted from the filamentous deposits in familial MSTD consists only of tau isoforms with four repeats. These findings reveal that a departure from the normal ratio of four-repeat to three-repeat tau isoforms leads to the formation of abnormal tau filaments. The results show that dysregulation of tau protein production can cause neurodegeneration and imply that the FTDP-17 gene is the tau gene.

The IF2 cells synthesise an H-chain of reduced size in which the CH1 homology region is missing. Sizing of the IF2 H-chain mRNA and wild-type H-chain mRNA revealed that the deletion is expressed at the mRNA level. The mutant H-chain mRNA sedimented at 16-S, enabling effective resolution from 18-S ribosomal RNA. In experiments using IF2 cells labelled with [32P]phosphate, the 16-S mRNA was purified by oligo(T)-cellulose chromatography. Polyacrylamide gel analysis of the poly(A)-containing fraction showed the presence of a single radioactive band. Comparison of the mobility of this band relative to markers of known molecular weight revealed that the molecule contained about 1600 nucleotides. Digestion of the 32-P-labelled mRNA with T1 ribonuclease and two-dimensional fractionation of the resulting oligonucleotides yielded a 'finger-print' suitable for a preliminary sequence analysis. By using the established amino acid sequence of the IF2 H-chain and a knowledge of the genetic code, 14 oligonucleotides were assigned within the constant region and four within the variable region of the IF2 H-chain. This sequence data accounts for 19.5% of the coding region. Several other oligonucleotides, which could not be assigned within the coding region but which occurred in approximately molar yield, have also been partially characterised.

The encoded protein lacks the membrane-binding and COOH-terminal regulatory domains, and it is therefore not susceptible to negative regulation by cholesterol. Livers from the transgenic mice showed increases in mRNAs encoding multiple enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis, the LDL receptor, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The elevations in mRNA for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) synthase and HMG CoA reductase were especially marked (13-fold and 75-fold, respectively). As a result, the transgenic livers showed a 28-fold increase in the rate of cholesterol synthesis and a lesser fourfold increase in fatty acid synthesis, as measured by intraperitoneal injection of [3H]water. These results contrast with previously reported effects of dominant-positive SREBP-1a, which activated fatty acid synthesis more than cholesterol synthesis. In adipose tissue of the SREBP-2 transgenics, the mRNAs for cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes were elevated, but the mRNAs for fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes were not. We conclude that SREBP-2 is a relatively selective activator of cholesterol synthesis, as opposed to fatty acid synthesis, in liver and adipose tissue of mice.",1998,25,666,38,9,22,24,30,54,36,29,31,24,27

We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose RC-160, 3 mg day–1 on week 1 increased to 4.5 mg day–1 for weeks 2–4 and subsequently 6 mg day–1 until the end of treatment, administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion in the management of 14 women with previously treated metastatic breast cancer. The age range was 37–80 years (median 58.5 years) and performance status 0–2. The treatment was well tolerated with no dose reductions being required. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were seen. Abscess formation developed at the infusion site in eight patients and erythema and discomfort was seen in a further three patients. A significant reduction in IGF-I levels occurred by day 7 and was maintained throughout the treatment. The lowest dose of RC-160 produced the maximal IGF-I response. Although there was no reduction in prolactin levels in patients whose baseline levels were normal, elevated prolactin levels found in three patients fell to within the normal range 7 days after commencing RC-160 treatment. A small but significant rise in fasting blood glucose levels was also recorded, the highest level on treatment being 7.6 mmol l–1. No objective tumour responses were observed, all patients showing disease progression within 3 months of commencing treatment.

Synapsins consist of a series of conserved and variable structural domains of unknown function. We performed a systematic structure-function analysis of the various domains of synapsin by assessing the actions of synapsin fragments on neurotransmitter release, presynaptic ultrastructure, and the biochemical interactions of synapsin. Injecting a peptide derived from domain A into the squid giant presynaptic terminal inhibited neurotransmitter release in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This peptide had no effect on vesicle pool size, synaptic depression, or transmitter release kinetics. In contrast, a peptide fragment from domain C reduced the number of synaptic vesicles in the periphery of the active zone and increased the rate and extent of synaptic depression. This peptide also slowed the kinetics of neurotransmitter release without affecting the number of docked vesicles. The domain C peptide, as well as another peptide from domain E that is known to have identical effects on vesicle pool size and release kinetics, both specifically interfered with the binding of synapsins to actin but not with the binding of synapsins to synaptic vesicles. This suggests that both peptides interfere with release by preventing interactions of synapsins with actin. Thus, interactions of domains C and E with the actin cytoskeleton may allow synapsins to perform two roles in regulating release, whereas domain A has an actin-independent function that regulates transmitter release in a phosphorylation-sensitive manner.",2005,95,123,2,4,8,15,11,9,16,7,10,6,6

Substrates are targeted to a single soluble protease, the 26S proteasome, in eukaryotes and to a number of unrelated proteases in prokaryotes. A surprising link emerged with the discovery of the ATP-dependent protease HslVU (heat shock locus VU) in Escherichia coli. Its protease component HslV shares approximately 20% sequence similarity and a conserved fold with 20S proteasome beta-subunits. HslU is a member of the Hsp100 (Clp) family of ATPases. Here we report the crystal structures of free HslU and an 820,000 relative molecular mass complex of HslU and HslV-the first structure of a complete set of components of an ATP-dependent protease. HslV and HslU display sixfold symmetry, ruling out mechanisms of protease activation that require a symmetry mismatch between the two components. Instead, there is conformational flexibility and domain motion in HslU and a localized order-disorder transition in HslV. Individual subunits of HslU contain two globular domains in relative orientations that correlate with nucleotide bound and unbound states. They are surprisingly similar to their counterparts in N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, the prototype of an AAA-ATPase. A third, mostly alpha-helical domain in HslU mediates the contact with HslV and may be the structural equivalent of the amino-terminal domains in proteasomal AAA-ATPases.",2000,0,161,24,5,5,10,6,12,9,11,7,11,11

Thus we asked whether Wnt factors are involved in patterning of the nervous system along this axis. We show that Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a, both of which are expressed in the dorsal portion of the neural tube, could synergize with the neural inducers noggin and chordin in Xenopus animal explants to generate the most dorsal neural structure, the neural crest, as determined by the expression of Krox-20, AP-2, and slug. Overexpression of Wnt-1 or Wnt-3a in the neuroectoderm of whole embryos led to a dramatic increase of slug and Krox-20-expressing cells, but the hindbrain expression of Krox-20 remained unaffected. Enlargement in the neural crest population could occur even when cell proliferation was inhibited. Wnt-5A and Wnt-8, neither of which is expressed in the dorsal neuroectoderm, failed to induce neural crest markers. Overexpression of glycogen synthase kinase 3, known to antagonize Wnt signaling, blocked the neural-crest-inducing activity of Wnt-3a in animal explants and inhibited neural crest formation in whole embryos. We suggest that Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a have a role in patterning the neural tube along its dorsoventral axis and function in the differentiation of the neural crest.",1997,57,318,13,0,5,17,16,20,15,14,20,26,13

However, the hydrazone moiety of Compd B results in toxic metabolites, making it a poor candidate for further drug development. We developed a pharmacophore model based on diverse antiprion compounds identified by high-throughput screening; based on this model, we generated biaryl amide analogs of Compd B. Medicinal chemistry optimization led to multiple compounds with increased potency, increased brain concentrations, and greater metabolic stability, indicating that they could be promising candidates for antiprion therapy. Replacing the pyridyl ring of Compd B with a phenyl group containing an electron-donating substituent increased potency, while adding an aryl group to the oxazole moiety increased metabolic stability. To test the efficacy of Compd B, we applied bioluminescence imaging (BLI), which was previously shown to detect prion disease onset in live mice earlier than clinical signs. In our studies, Compd B showed good efficacy in two lines of transgenic mice infected with the mouse-adapted Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) strain of prions, but not in transgenic mice infected with human prions. The BLI system successfully predicted the efficacies in all cases long before extension in survival could be observed.

Using Hartree–Fock data to estimate ζ, which typically differs from the actual charge Z by ∼1% or less, we find this dimensional renormalization method (denoted DR‐0) gives results substantially better than the HF input. Comparison of the 1/Z expansion for the large‐D limit with that for D=3 atoms provides expressions for the leading error terms in the renormalized total energy and correlation energy. When configuration mixing occurs in the Z→∞ limit (as for Be and many other atoms), we find the renormalization procedure is markedly improved by including the zeroth‐order mixing (denoted DR‐1); this contributes a term linear in Z. Including the Z‐independent term (DR‐2) also improves the accuracy when zeroth‐order mixing is absent (e.g., ground‐state atoms with N=2, 3, and 7–11) but not otherwise.

The results can be interpreted in terms of an exchange interaction $A{\mathrm{I}}_{1}\ifmmode\cdot\else\textperiodcentered\fi{}{\mathrm{I}}_{2}$ between a pair of nuclear spins which exceeds the normal dipolar interaction. The exchange between different isotopes leads to broadening. Exchange between like nuclei should lead to narrowing, but it was found that samples containing 98.7 percent ${\mathrm{Tl}}^{205}$ still exhibit lines broader than the dipolar interaction. Two causes are shown to exist: anisotropy of the chemical shift and pseudodipolar exchange interaction. Analysis with the method of the moments gives for the exchange interaction constant $A{h}^{\ensuremath{-}1}=17.5$ kc/sec with a 30 percent anisotropic pseudo-dipolar character in the hexagonal metal, and $A{h}^{\ensuremath{-}1}=12$ kc/sec with less than 10 percent pseudo-dipolar character in thallic oxide.

In contrast, AlSb buffers generate a very rough interface on the same scale. Van der Pauw measurements show that this results in a greatly reduced low-temperature mobility for InAs quantum wells grown on AlSb buffers.

Using the ultrafast T-jump, we examined this process, specifically the transformation of aqua cobalt (II) complexes to their fully halogenated species. The results reveal a stepwise mechanism with time scales varying from hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds. The dynamics are significantly faster when the structure is retained but becomes rate-limited when the octahedral-to-tetrahedral structural change bottlenecks the transformation. Evidence is presented, from bimolecular kinetics and energetics (enthalpic and entropic), for a reaction in which the ligand assists the displacement of water molecules, with the retention of the entering ligand in the activated state. The reaction time scale deviates by one to two orders of magnitude from that of ionic diffusion, suggesting the involvement of a collisional barrier between the ion and the much larger complex.",2008,29,23,0,1,0,2,3,2,2,0,2,2,1

An improved novel plasmid backbone, pTrial10, has been developed. We have used this vector to deliver the cDNA for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to cells, both in vitro and in vivo, complexed with cationic liposomes. 2. Human 293 kidney epithelial cells (HEK 293) showed expression of an immunoprecipitable 165 kDa protein corresponding to CFTR when transfected in vitro with pTrial10‐CFTR2, but not when the vector pTrial10 was used. 3. HEK 293 cells transfected with pTrial10‐CFTR2, but not pTrial10, demonstrated a cAMP‐dependent anion conductance, measured by fluorescence microscopy using a halide‐sensitive probe, SPQ. 4. The CFTR‐dependent, cAMP‐sensitive chloride secretory response in murine tracheal epithelium could be measured if the calcium‐dependent chloride secretory process was first maximally stimulated with a mixture of the Ca(2+)‐ATPase inhibitor, TBHQ, and the calcium ionophore, A23187. With these conditions wild‐type and CF‐null (transgenic animals in which the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene has been disrupted so that no CFTR is produced) murine tracheas could be distinguished. The difference between the current elicited by forskolin in wild‐type and CF tracheas was highly significantly different (P < 0.001), giving a CFTR‐dependent current of 11.2 microA cm‐2. 5. Transfection of the airways with pTrial10‐CFTR2, but not pTrial10, significantly (P < 0.01) increased the CFTR‐dependent chloride secretory current in CF tracheas.

A nonconservative point mutation in the mouse Unc93b1 gene has been associated with defective Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and impaired major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II restricted antigen responses. Like murine UNC-93B, the human homologue is predicted to form 12 transmembrane domains, and it localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. In human beings its expression is highest in professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages. Interestingly, UNC-93B itself is specifically induced by TLR3 signaling in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages. To study the effect of UNC-93B deficiency in TLR signaling and antigen-presentation in human beings, UNC-93B message was knocked down in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and a reduced TNFalpha production in response to TLR3 agonists was observed. In the same experiment, the achieved knockdown had no effect on an MHC II-dependent antigen response, suggesting that the reduced quantity of human UNC-93B was still capable of supporting class II antigen presentation or that UNC-93B is not required for class II antigen presentation in human antigen-presenting cells.",2007,10,17,1,0,0,1,1,0,7,3,0,0,0

We examined the effects of shRNA expression in primary human lymphocytes (PBLs) using lentiviral vectors bearing different RNA polymerase III promoters. We found that the U6 promoter is more efficient than the H1 promoter for shRNA expression and for reducing expression of CCR5 in PBLs. However, shRNA expression from the U6 promoter resulted in a gradual decline of the transduced cell populations. With one CCR5 shRNA this decline could be attributed to elevated apoptosis but another CCR5 shRNA that caused cytotoxicity did not show evidence of apoptosis, suggesting sequence-specific mechanisms for cytotoxicity. In contrast to the U6 promoter, PBLs transduced by vectors expressing shRNAs from the H1 promoter could be maintained without major cytotoxic effects. Since a lower level of shRNA expression appears to be advantageous to maintaining the shRNA-transduced population, lentiviral vectors bearing the H1 promoter are more suitable for stable transduction and expression of shRNA in primary human T lymphocytes. Our results suggest that functional shRNA screens should include tests for both potency and adverse metabolic effects upon primary cells.",2006,48,150,3,0,11,10,22,21,10,15,16,13,8

II,"This paper is a direct continuation of an earlier paper (I) where an attempt was made to set up a field-theoretic foundation for the theory of mean mass and lifetime of an unstable particle. It was argued in I that the decay-time plot of a beam of unstable particles is a concept peculiar to a single-particle theory; that from a field-theoretic point of view, mass (the variable conjugate to proper time) rather than time has the primary significance. Here we show that the spectral function $\ensuremath{\rho}({m}^{2})$ appearing in the (field-theoretic) one-particle propagator has a direct significance as the probability of finding in production an unstable particle of mass $m$. This allows us to define a ""one-particle"" state for the unstable particle as a superposition of its outgoing decay states suitably weighted in mass space [with a factor which is the square-root of $\ensuremath{\rho}({m}^{2})$].

To investigate the role of V gene replacements in the generation of antigen-specific antibodies, we analyzed antiviral immunoglobulin responses of “quasimonoclonal” (QM) mice. The B cells of QM mice are genetically committed to exclusively express the anti-(4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl specificity. However, ∼20% of the peripheral B cells of QM mice undergo secondary rearrangements and thereby potentially acquire new specificities. QM mice infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, or poliovirus mounted virus-specific neutralizing antibody responses. In general, kinetics of the antiviral immunoglobulin responses were delayed in QM mice; however, titers similar to control animals were eventually produced that were sufficient to protect against VSV-induced lethal disease. VSV neutralizing single-chain Fv fragments isolated from phage display libraries constructed from QM mice showed VH gene replacements and extensive hypermutation. Thus, our data demonstrate that secondary rearrangements and hypermutation can generate sufficient B cell diversity in QM mice to mount protective antiviral antibody responses, suggesting that these mechanisms might also contribute to the diversification of the B cell repertoire of normal mice.",1999,55,29,0,0,5,3,4,3,1,0,1,3,2

The curve is complex, first falling and then rising with increasing speed. The reasons for the form of the curve are discussed. Carlson, Hardy & Wilkie (1963 a, b) reported recently that in after-loaded isotonic twitches the heat production remained about constant when the load was varied. They concluded that in the complete cycle of a twitch there is no evidence for heat of shortening. In the present experiments, in which the speed of shortening was varied instead of the load, the results were quite different. The heat altered considerably and the heat of shortening was obvious. An explanation of the contradiction is offered. Mean curves are given for the heat H, the total energy (H + W) and the efficiency W/(H + W) as functions of the velocity of shortening in a twitch.

This absence is explained here in terms of spallation and thermonuclear reactions destroying D and T after energetic protons (approx.100 MeV) cause the nearly complete spallation of /sup 4/He. This requires a high-temperature, high-density plasma in order that the necessary proton current not exceed energy limitations. An analysis of the X-ray observations of solar flares and the upper limit to any beam current due to its self-magnetic energy indicates the presence of thermal kT/sub e/< or =200 keV plasma. The plasma density must then be large enough, n/sub e/approx. =3 x 10/sup 15/ cm/sup -3/, that spallation takes place efficiently within the extended proton range and the length of the flux tube approx.2 x 10/sup 9/ cm. Most probably these regions of high density, n/sub e/approx. =3 x 10/sup 15/ cm/sup -3/,kT/sub e/approx. =200 keV, are due to current filaments (radius approx.70 cm) formed in an instability of a helical flux tube heated partially by a proton current. This density and temperature then lasts long enoughmore » (approx.10 s) to destroy D and T by thermonuclear reactions. Li, Be, and B from the spallation of CNO are similarly destroyed while an ion runaway electric field ensures the preferential retention of the high-Z nuclei. Finally, the retained products in the current filament must be released and further accelerated if they are to appear at the earth as cosmic rays.« less",1977,0,21,0,0,1,2,0,1,1,1,3,1,2

Overexpression of miR-125b alone in mice causes a very aggressive, transplantable myeloid leukemia. Before leukemia, these mice do not display elevation of white blood cells in the spleen or bone marrow; rather, the hematopoietic compartment shows lineage-skewing, with myeloid cell numbers dramatically increased and B-cell numbers severely diminished. miR-125b exerts this effect by up-regulating the number of common myeloid progenitors while inhibiting development of pre-B cells. We applied a miR-125b sponge loss of function system in vivo to show that miR-125b physiologically regulates hematopoietic development. Investigating the mechanism by which miR-125b regulates hematopoiesis, we found that, among a panel of candidate targets, the mRNA for Lin28A, an induced pluripotent stem cell gene, was most repressed by miR-125b in mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Overexpressing Lin28A in the mouse hematopoietic system mimicked the phenotype observed on inhibiting miR-125b function, leading to a decrease in hematopoietic output. Relevant to the miR-125b overexpression phenotype, we also found that knockdown of Lin28A led to hematopoietic lineage-skewing, with increased myeloid and decreased B-cell numbers. Thus, the miR-125b target Lin28A is an important regulator of hematopoiesis and a primary target of miR-125b in the hematopoietic system.",2012,31,140,4,11,27,23,14,14,10,12,8,11,9

It was found that excitons localized at deep trap centers play an important role in the recombination process.

One of the tandem C₂ domains of E-Syt2 is predicted to bind Ca²⁺, but no Ca²⁺-dependent function has been attributed to this protein. We have determined the crystal structures of the tandem C₂ domains of E-Syt2 in the absence and presence of Ca²⁺ and analyzed their Ca²⁺-binding properties by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our data reveal an unexpected V-shaped structure with a rigid orientation between the two C₂ domains that is not substantially altered by Ca²⁺. The E-Syt2 C2A domain binds up to four Ca²⁺ ions, whereas the C₂B domain does not bind Ca²⁺. These results suggest that E-Syt2 performs an as yet unidentified Ca²⁺-dependent function through its C₂A domain and uncover fundamental differences between the properties of the tandem C₂ domains of E-Syts and synaptotagmins.",2014,73,43,9,3,6,9,7,4,4,3,7,0,0

Among these are regulation of cell cycle, modulation of the immune and inflammatory responses, control of signal transduction pathways, development and differentiation. These complex processes are controlled via specific degradation of a single or a subset of proteins. Degradation of a protein by the ubiquitin system involves two successive steps, conjugation of multiple moieties of ubiquitin and degradation of the tagged protein by the 26S proteasome. An important question concerns the identity of the mechanisms that underlie the high degree of specificity of the system. Substrate recognition is governed by a large family ubiquitin ligases that recognize the substrates, bind them and catalyze/facilitate their interaction with ubiquitin.

The technique has proved particularly successful in studying 2D electron systems, revealing a number of interesting many-body effects. Here, we use large-area high-quality graphene capacitors to study behavior of the density of states in this material in zero and high magnetic fields. Clear renormalization of the linear spectrum due to electron–electron interactions is observed in zero field. Quantizing fields lead to splitting of the spin- and valley-degenerate Landau levels into quartets separated by interaction-enhanced energy gaps. These many-body states exhibit negative compressibility but the compressibility returns to positive in ultrahigh B. The reentrant behavior is attributed to a competition between field-enhanced interactions and nascent fractional states.",2013,35,207,3,13,28,23,17,21,19,29,42,5,0
3f43d6a9c4452b81e32616bfb05f8dcaced46322,Early two-dimensional reconstruction and recent topics stemming from it.,"In 1955 I was a Lecturer in Physics at the University of Cape Town when the Hospital Physicist at the Groote Schuur Hospital resigned. South African law required that a properly qualified physicist supervise the use of any radioactive isotopes, and since I was the only nuclear physicist in Cape Town, I was asked to spend 1 1/2 days a week at the hospital attending to the use of isotopes, and I did so for the first half of 1956. I was placed in the Radiology Department under Dr. J. Muir Grieve, and in the course of my work I observed the planning of radiotherapy treatments. A girl would superpose isodose charts and come up with isodose contours which the physician would then examine and adjust, and the process would be repeated until a satisfactory dose-distribution was found. The isodose charts were for homogeneous materials, and it occurred to me that since the human body is quite inhomogeneous these results would be quite distorted by the inhomogeneities a fact that physicians were, of course, well aware of. It occurred to me that in order to improve treatment planning one had to know the distribution of the attenuation coefficient of tissues in the body, and that this distribution had to be found by measurements made external to the body. It soon occurred to me that this information would be useful for diagnostic purposes and would constitute a tomogram or series of tomograms, though I did not learn the word “tomogram” for many years. At that time the exponential attenuation of Xand gamma-rays had been known and used for over sixty years with parallel sided homogeneous slabs of material. I assumed that the generalization to inhomogeneous materials had been made in those sixty years, but a search of the pertinent literature did not reveal that it had been done, so I was forced to look at the problem ab initio. It was immediately evident that the problem was a mathematical one which can be seen from Fig. 1. If a fine beam of gamma-rays of intensity I, is incident on the body and the emerging intensity is I, then the measurable quantity g = In(I0/I) = SLfds, where f is the variable absorption coefficient along the line L. Hence if f is a function in two dimensions, and g is known for all lines intersecting the body, the question is: “Can f be determined if g is known ?“. Again this seemed like a problem which would",1980,10,66,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
5f8430eba7cfbb0d52be24e1f09be44ccfeefc80,Reduction in cholesterol and low density lipoprotein synthesis after portacaval shunt surgery in a patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.,"The turnover of 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) and the total body balance of cholestrol were studied in a 6-yr-old girl with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) before and after the surgical creation of an end-to-side portacaval shunt. The results were compared with those of similar studies simultaneously performed in untreated patients with the heterozygous form of FH and with the results of earlier studies performed on normolipidemic subjects. Before shunt surgery, the rate of synthesis of LDL in the FH homozygote (mg/kg per day) was fourfold higher than in normolipidemic subjects and twofold higher than in her heterozygous mother. The fractional catabolic rate for LDL in the homozygote was decreased to 33% of normal control values. The rate of cholesterol synthesis, estimated by chemical sterol balance, was higher in the FH homozygote than in two FH heterozygotes of similar age studied simultaneously. When considered in relation to the markedly elevated level of plasma cholesterol, the observed rate of cholesterol synthesis in the FH homozygote was inappropriately elevated. Bile acid production was normal in all three children. 5 mo after shunt surgery, the rate of LDL synthesis in the homozygote had declined by 48% as compared with the preoperative value, and this caused a 39% drop in the plasma LDL cholesterol level despite a 17% reduction in the fractional catabolic rate of the lipoprotein. The rate of cholesterol synthesis fell by 62% as compared with the preoperative value. The findings of an inappropriately elevated rate of production of both cholesterol and LDL as well as a reduced fractional catabolic rate for the lipoprotein in the untreated FH homozygote are consistent with results of studies in cultured fibroblasts indicating that the primary genetic defect in FH involves a deficiency in a cell-surface receptor for LDL that regulates both cholesterol synthesis and LDL degradation. Although the mechanism for the decline in production of cholesterol and LDL after portacaval shunt surgery is unknown, it was observed that these changes were associated with marked increases in the plasma concentrations of bile acids and glucagon.",1975,42,222,3,0,13,16,8,17,15,7,10,15,11

Doherty & Zinkernagel 1975). Immunology had been primed for this response by Jerne's (1971) provocative proposal that the repertoire of lymphocyte specificities for foreign (non-MHC) antigens was derived, by somatic mutation, from the V-gene poo! coding tor recognition of the self MHC glycoproteins possessed by the individual. The thymus could thus be regarded as a mutant breeding organ for the generation of MHCrestricted precursor T cells, an argument which fitted well with the later 'altered self 'interaction antigen' hypotheses (Zinkernagel & Doherty 1974, Doherty & Zinkertiagel 1975, Doherty et al. 1976. Bevan 1977). The debate was focused on the thymus in a much more direct way when Zinkernagel (Zinkernagel et al. 1978b, Zinkernagel 1978) found that adult thymectomized (PI Xp2)Fi radiation chimeras, that had been reconstituted with (PiXP:)F| bone marrow cells and an irradiated Pi thymus graft, subsequently developed virus-immune CTL responses that were totally restricted to Pi. The spectrum of MHC-restricted effector function shown by mature T cells was considered to reflect physiological differentiation processes that were in some way dictated by radiation-resistant thymus epithelium (Zinkernagel 1978).

58d95ec35389380ebdcb3930046295dea177245e,Near-infrared absorption of YBa2Cu3O7−δ: Evidence for Bose-Einstein condensation of small bipolarons,Abstract A significant change with temperature in intensity of the optical absorption spectrum of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ in the range 2000 to 10000 cm −1 at the superconducting transition is shown to be a manifestation of Bose-Einstein condensation of small bipolarons. The sum rule for bipolaronic infrared absorption is derived and applied for the explanation of this unusual effect on the basis of the polaron theory of high- T c superconductivity. The temperature dependence of the normal state absorption is controlled by the thermal excitation of singlet inter-site bipolarons into triplet states. As determined from optical absorption experiments singlet-triplet exchange energy has the same value as the spin gap discovered by Rossat Mignod et al. by neutron scattering.,1993,48,21,0,0,4,2,3,3,1,2,0,2,0

The transition seen by some investigators at between 2.9 and 7.5 mM ionic strength is not observed by small-angle neutron scattering in either type of nucleosome particle. The two contrasts measured (H2O and D2O) indicate that only small conformational changes occur in the protein core, but the DNA is partially unfolded below the transition point. Patterson inversion of the data and analysis of models indicate that the DNA in both types of particle is unwinding from the ends, leaving about one turn of supercoiled DNA bound to the histone core in approximately its normal (compact) conformation. The mechanism of unfolding appears to be similar for both types of particles and in both cases occurs at the same ionic strength. The unfolding observed for nucleosomes in this study is in definite disagreement with extended superhelical models for the DNA and also disagrees with models incorporating an unfolded histone core.",1983,39,40,0,0,1,4,6,2,3,1,1,3,3

Hill (1) to deduce that the processes, whatever they be, which determine the development of a contraction when a tetanus begins, are the same as those which determine the redevelopment of the contraction after a sudden release during a tetanus. The observation and the deduction from it were used by Garner (2) in support of his hypothesis that contraction is due to the formation of some molecular pattern in the muscle substance, of something analogous to liquid crystals on the surfaces or throughout the volume of the fibre. It was obviously desirable to test this observation—of what is perhaps the simplest and most fundamental of the phenomena described by the term “viscous-elastic”—on some contractile tissue as different as possible from the voluntary muscle of the frog. During a recent visit to the Marine Biological Laboratory at Plymouth, Mr. C. F. A. Pantin and Mr. G. P. Wells introduced me to the longitudinal muscles of the body wall of Holothuria nigra , a set of five smooth muscles running the whole length of the animal’s body, easy to prepare, able to survive for long periods in sea-water, and capable of being excited, either by single shocks or by a slow tetanus, to produce a very considerable tension.",1926,2,41,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,2,1,0
c679b7366d54b58aa6df1128aebfd28523eece07,Accessory cell-T lymphocyte interactions. Antigen-dependent and - independent clustering,"Previous work documented the capacity of dendritic cells (DC) to stimulate primary immune responses and to physically cluster with the responding lymphocytes. Rapid cell-cell aggregation assays were used here to study the interaction of DC and other types of APC with T lymphocytes. Graded doses of APC were sedimented with T cells that had been primed to alloantigens, soluble proteins, or lectin, and then labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate. The number of clustered T cells was measured after 10 min at 4 or 37 degrees C. At 4 degrees, binding was antigen-dependent and included greater than 50% of the added T cells. Clustering was mediated by all types of APC tested, including DC, macrophages, B lymphocytes, and fresh Langerhans cells, although DC were the most effective. Specificity was evident in the findings that alloreactive T lymphoblasts bound to allogeneic but not syngeneic APC; KLH- and OVA-reactive T cells bound to syngeneic APC in the presence of specific protein: and Con A blasts needed lectin to cluster. A 30 min pretreatment with chloroquine, a drug known to inhibit APC activity, markedly blocked the specific binding of alloreactive and protein-specific T blasts at 4 degrees C. Since Lyt-2- alloreactive blasts should specifically recognize Ia, presentation of Ia seems to be altered by chloroquine. Binding assays at 37 degrees C gave similar results to those performed at 4 degrees C, with one exception. When DC were used as APC, striking antigen-independent clustering occurred. DC could efficiently cluster primed T cells in the absence of alloantigen, soluble protein, or lectin. We suggest that antigen-independent binding contributes to the distinctive capacity of DC to prime T cells in the afferent limb of the immune response, whereas antigen-dependent binding between other APC and sensitized lymphocytes is critical in the efferent limb.",1986,17,201,3,4,12,26,16,13,16,5,12,2,7

We have raised antibodies against the cdc2+ protein using synthetic peptides and have demonstrated that it is a 34 kd phosphoprotein with protein kinase activity. The protein level and phosphorylation state remain unchanged during the mitotic cycle of rapidly growing cells. When cells cease to proliferate and arrest in G1 the protein becomes dephosphorylated and loses protein kinase activity. Exit from the mitotic cycle and entry into stationary phase may be controlled in part by modulation of the cdc2 protein kinase activity by changes in its phosphorylation state.,1986,31,436,7,2,15,32,52,46,35,36,20,10,11

In this study, we examined the trafficking of AN-162 into the cell, the expression of the somatostatin receptors (sstr) in specimens of human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), and the effect of AN-162 on HCC 1806 human TNBC xenografts. The expression of sstr in TNBC tumor samples was investigated by immunohistochemical staining. The expression of sstr in HCC 1806 was evaluated by reverse transcription PCR. Internalization studies with 125I-labeled AN-162 were carried out and the autofluorescence sign of doxorubicin moiety in the cell nucleus after incubation with AN-162 was measured using a fluorescence assay. The effects of AN-162 on the growth of HCC 1806 xenografted into nude mice were studied. A fluorescence microscopy cytotoxicity assay in vitro to detect cell death after treatment with AN-162 was also carried out. About 28% of TNBC tumor specimens showed a positive staining for sstr subtype 2a. HCC 1806 expresses all five subtypes of sstr. In the fluorescence cytotoxicity assay, dead HCC 1806 cells were found 24 h after incubation with AN-162. The growth of HCC 1806 tumors in nude mice was significantly inhibited by treatment with AN-162. AN-162 was internalized into the HCC 1806 cells and doxorubicin moiety was detected in the cell nuclei. This study is the first to show that the trafficking of the cytotoxic sst analogue AN-162 into the cell is mediated by sstr. Our work shows that the growth of xenografted HCC 1806 TNBCs can be effectively inhibited in vivo with AN-162. This investigation provides information on the mechanism of action and efficacy of this new targeted cytotoxic sst analogue and identifies in this relation the sstr as a favorable therapeutic target in TNBC.",2013,46,19,0,3,3,5,1,2,3,0,0,2,0

Although polymorphisms within the first intron of the FTO gene have been associated with obesity, the physiological role of FTO remains unknown. Here we show that a R316Q mutation, inactivating FTO enzymatic activity, is responsible for an autosomal-recessive lethal syndrome. Cultured skin fibroblasts from affected subjects showed impaired proliferation and accelerated senescence. These findings indicate that FTO is essential for normal development of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems in human and establish that a mutation in a human member of the AlkB-related dioxygenase family results in a severe polymalformation syndrome.",2009,25,311,10,6,26,20,8,31,26,26,27,22,30

Nude mice implanted with SW‐1990 tumors received s.c. injections of RC‐3095 and RC‐3940‐II or the vehicle (control) for 28 days. Chronic administration of RC‐3940‐II inhibited the growth of SW‐1990 tumors, as shown by a reduction in tumor volume during the treatment and a significant increase in tumor doubling time. RC‐3940‐II decreased final tumor volume by 57.7% and tumor growth rate by 65%. Final tumor weights in mice treated with RC‐3940‐II were 75% lower than in controls. Treatment with RC‐3095 induced smaller, and not significant, decreases in tumor volume and weight. In cell cultures, both RC‐3095 and RC‐3940‐II effectively inhibited the proliferation of SW‐1990 cells, inducing a dose‐ and time‐dependent decrease in the number of cells. RC‐3940‐II again suppressed in vitro growth of SW‐1990 cells more effectively than RC‐3095. After 72 hr of culture, RC‐3940‐II and RC‐3095 at I μM concentrations decreased cell numbers by 45.7% and 27.7%, respectively. The estimated EC50 value for RC‐3940‐II was I nM. When SW‐1990 cells were cultured in the presence of I nM and 10 nM RC‐3095 for 72 hr, cAMP levels in the incubation medium were decreased to 77.3% and 26.9% of the control value.

We have expressed the catalytic domain of MT-SP1 and solved the crystal structures of complexes with benzamidine at 1.3 Å and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor at 2.9 Å. MT-SP1 exhibits a trypsin-like serine proteinase fold, featuring a unique nine-residue 60-insertion loop that influences interactions with protein substrates. The structure discloses a trypsin-like S1 pocket, a small hydrophobic S2 subsite, and an open negatively charged S4 cavity that favors the binding of basic P3/P4 residues. A complementary charge pattern on the surface opposite the active site cleft suggests a distinct docking of the preceding low density lipoprotein receptor class A domain. The benzamidine crystals possess a freely accessible active site and are hence well suited for soaking small molecules, facilitating the improvement of inhibitors.

We recently identified dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) as an antimigratory phosphoprotein in breast cancer cells. Here we link this effect of DARPP-32 to Wnt-5a signaling by demonstrating that recombinant Wnt-5a triggers cAMP elevation at the plasma membrane and Thr34-DARPP-32 phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells. In agreement, both protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Frizzled-3 receptor or Gαs expression abolished Wnt-5a-induced phosphorylation of DARPP-32. Furthermore, Wnt-5a induced DARPP-32-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 cell migration. Phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32 interacted with protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and potentiated the Wnt-5a-mediated phosphorylation of CREB, a well-known PP1 substrate, but had no effect on CREB phosphorylation by itself. Moreover, inhibition of the Wnt-5a/DARPP-32/CREB pathway, by expression of dominant negative CREB (DN-CREB), diminished the antimigratory effect of Wnt-5a-induced phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32. Phalloidin-staining revealed that that the presence of phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32 in MCF-7 cells results in reduced filopodia formation. In accordance, the activity of the Rho GTPase Cdc42, known to be crucial for filopodia formation, was reduced in MCF-7 cells expressing phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32. The effects of DARPP-32 on cell migration and filopodia formation could be reversed in T47D breast cancer cells that were depleted of their endogenous DARPP-32 by siRNA targeting. Consequently, Wnt-5a activates a Frizzled-3/Gαs/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway that triggers a DARPP-32- and CREB-dependent antimigratory response in breast cancer cells, representing a novel mechanism whereby Wnt-5a can inhibit breast cancer cell migration.",2009,43,65,6,1,3,4,7,12,9,7,6,1,5

Data are presented which suggest that DRw and/or PL products could be distinct from the Dw products, involved in primary MLR.

The axisymmetric perturbations of this special solution are analysed in prolate spheroidal coordinates. In this paper, the analysis is restricted to axial perturbations. The problem is reduced to a pair of coupled partial differential equations. The equations allow the definition of an energy-flux whose divergence vanishes. The asymptotic behaviours of the solutions at infinity and at the two singularities (where the horizons of the two black-holes are located) are determined. It is shown that in the vicinity of the singularities, the gravitational and the electromagnetic radiation prevails as coupled photon-graviton waves expressed in terms of a common amplitude and phase, for each specified angular momentum. The scattering of radiation by the two black-holes is a four-channel problem (in the terminology of nuclear physics). The four channels correspond to the incidence of the two sorts of radiation (gravitational and electromagnetic) from infinity and the incidence of the coupled photon-graviton waves on the horizons of the two black-holes. The flux integral, evaluated at infinity and at the two horizons, enables the formulation of the scattering problem in terms of a scattering matrix; and provides four identities among the scattering amplitudes as expressions of the conservation of energy in the scattering process. In an Appendix, the equations of geodesic motion in the space-time of the two black-holes are derived; and three families of null geodesics in the meridian plane are displayed.",1989,7,36,1,2,2,3,1,1,0,1,4,0,1

The optimal rate of nutrient addition (and consequently the productivity) is ultimately limited by the rate at which cells can aerobically catabolize the carbon source without generating growth-inhibitory metabolites such as lactate and acetate8,9. All approaches thus far have concentrated on improving the oxygen mass transfer rates by manipulating various environmental parameters. We10 have isolated the gene for a haemoglobin-like molecule, expressed by the aerobic bacterium Vitreoscilla in poorly-oxygenated environments11,12, and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The recombinant cells contain enhanced haem as well as active haemoglobin, and they grow faster and to considerably greater cell densities than comparable plasmid-containing cells which do not express haemoglobin. This haemoglobin increases the rate of oxygen use, especially when dissolved oxygen is less than 5% of air saturation.",1988,13,222,7,1,4,7,6,6,4,12,6,9,6

There are two sets of data. In one the density and atomic weight of lead from thorite have been compared with the values of ordinary lead, and in the other a similar comparison has been made for the lead derived from two uranium minerals. These two sets, of course, cannot be compared together, as the densities of specimens are comparable only when they have been prepared under identical conditions. With due attention to this point the relative densities are, in the case of lead, capable of determination to a very high degree of accuracy.",1921,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

0acb1dfb408b85b7ad7ebf5d816bdf0d5c1bb6c9,Energy and absorption of the gamma-radiation from Li7 + H1,It is shown that a study of the pairs ejected from foils in a Wilson cloud chamber gives more reliable and useful information regarding gamma-radiation of very high energy than can be obtained from the recoil electrons. By this method the gamma-radiation from Li7 + H1 is found to consist of a line at 17.1±0.5 Mev of relative intensity 0.75 and probably one or more lines at about 14 Mev of relative intensity 0.25. No radiation is found between 2 and 10 Mev. The spectrum below 2 Mev has not been investigated. The distribution of recoil electrons is consistent with this and with the Klein-Nishina formula. The division of energy between members of pairs is in agreement with the predictions of Bethe and Heitler. It is shown that the usual method of measuring absorption coefficients leads to erroneous results for radiation much above 3 Mev and a method is described which depends on counting the number of high energy pairs observed in cloud chamber pictures taken alternately with and without 1 cm of lead in the beam. The results agree with theory within the experimental errors. The origin of the radiation is discussed and it is shown that the data can be accounted for if we assume that the proton is captured by the Li7 nucleus producing a Be8 nucleus in an odd state. According to Breit this should be a P state and the nucleus may drop to the ground state (1S) with emission of 17 Mev radiation or to an even state at 3 Mev (1D) and subsequently break up into two alpha-particles.,1937,0,14,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

The subunits preferentially form a heterodimer that activates transcription. Although p50 and p65 bind DNA individually as homodimers and are structurally related, their activation mechanisms are distinct. p65 activates transcription by its unique carboxy-terminal activation domain. (p50)2 displays higher affinity DNA binding than (p65)2 for many distinct kappa B motifs and provides strong transcriptional activation only when adopting a chymotrypsin-resistant conformation induced by certain kappa B motifs but not others. Thus, (p50)2 acts as a positive regulator in vitro, consistent with its isolation as a putative constitutive regulator of MHC class I genes.

The stage of maturation of the synapses was analysed by electron microscopy as well as by whole‐cell patch‐clamp recording. The acceleration in the functional maturation of neuromuscular synapses induced by synapsin I was accompanied by a profound rearrangement in the ultrastructure of the nerve terminal. Nerve terminals formed by synapsin I‐loaded neurons were characterized by a higher number of small synaptic vesicles organized in clusters and predominantly localized close to the nerve terminal plasma membrane, a smaller number of large dense‐core vesicles and no significant change in the number of coated vesicles. Precocious development of active zone‐like structures as well as deposition of basal lamina into the synaptic cleft were also observed at these synapses. These results support a role for synapsin I in the architectural changes which occur during synaptogenesis and lead to the maturation of quantal neurotransmitter release mechanisms.",1995,43,69,2,3,4,6,2,4,3,2,5,1,5

The present study demonstrates that the addition of ferredoxin and NADP+ in the presence of N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine (Tricine) buffer at pH 7.1 or higher mitigates the rapid loss of Biradical X [N,N'-bis(1-oxyl - 2,2,5,5 - tetramethylpyrroline-3-carboxy)-1,2-diaminoethane] and Monradical A (2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-carbamidpyrroline-1-oxyl). However, the 5-line EPR spectrum characteristic of Biradical X in aqueous solution was changed to a dominantly 3-line spectrum within a few minutes after illumination in the presence of ferredoxin and NADP+. Analysis of the double integration of the first derivative EPR spectrum revealed no decrease in Biradical X concentration for more than 30 min of illumination.

becd8d4a82e384cb57a2aa5eb9eed5b7d60f6949,Reply to Klar: Key role of YY1 in neoangiogenesis,"In our study (1), we investigated the role of YY1 and described a potential molecular mechanism of cross-talk between YY1 and the VEGF network. YY1 binds hypoxia-inducible factor-1α on VEGF regulatory region. The specific silencing of YY1 reduced VEGF transcription by approximately 20%, the availability of active VEGF protein via AKT, and neoangiogenesis (1). Klar (2) brings to our attention the possibility that these effects also may be mediated by the homolog protein YY2. First, we consider that proteins that play a critical role in the cell occur often in multiple distinct homologous forms but not necessarily with redundant functions. YY1 and YY2 are encoded by genes mapping on different chromosomes, transcribed mRNAs with different sizes, and the proteins have different molecular masses on SDS/PAGE (70 kDa and 58 kDa, respectively). Until now, all of the studies on YY family proteins have failed to address their interactions, despite their homology (3). Second, Klar suggests that YY1 and YY2 can compete for the same regulatory element. It is well established that the role of YY1 is expression dependent. YY1 is overexpressed in human osteosarcomas (4), and YY1 is essential for murine sarcoma metastasis and survival (5). In contrast, the expression pattern of YY2 is completely unknown, and YY1/YY2 relative expression was reported to be different among cell lines. In HeLa cells (3), YY2 was present as 10.3 ± 7 per nanogram of RNA, and YY1 was present as 751 ± 0.1 mRNA copies. Third, 10% of human genes contain YY1 binding sites on their promoter. However, because YY1 and YY2 recognize the same consensus sequences, they do not bind all of the same promoters (at least in humans), they do not have the same affinity and avidity, and they do not require the same binding partner (3). YY1 can compete with YY2 to bind the target sequence whereas the opposite has not been documented. Klar and Bode (6) reported that fivefold molar excess of YY2 is not able to rescue the effects of YY1 (their figure 6B), indicating that YY1 and YY2 bind the same sequences with a markedly different affinity. Finally, Klar requests technical clarification about the specificity of siRNA against YY1. We designed YY1 siRNA oligonucleotides that did not recognize YY2 mRNA, as demonstrated by BLAST analysis using the National Center for Biotechnology Information Map Viewer Genome Browser. The sequences used in our study were: for the upper strand, 5′GCTCCAAGAACAATAGCTTGCCGAAGCAAGCTATTGTTCTTGGAGC3′; for the bottom strand, 5′GCTCCAAGAACAATAGCTTGCTTCGGCAAGCTATTGTTCTTGGAGC3′. Additionally, there are also commercially available siRNA specific for YY1 (Sigma TRCN0000019894) that can be used alternatively in further investigations.",2010,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The pathway is relatively long and Hexamine Dinitrate and Dinitro Pentamethylene Tetramine (DPT) are two of the main intermediate compounds. The former was prepared, purified, and then characterized. Conversion of this compound into the latter has been followed up experimentally. Herein, we report the Preparation of Dinitro Pentamethylene Tetramine (DPT) from Hexamine Dinitrate as an alternative synthetic route which is an important intermediate appears through preparation of DPT from Hexamine directly. DPT was prepared at different temperatures. The variation of some factors like: temperature and time has been investigated. The obtained results were reliable and consistent with the literature. The conversion of Hexamine Dinitrate to HMX as another synthetic route was not fully studied from the point of view of kinetics. In this paper, it is intended to study the effect of time and temperature on the conversion rate of hexamine dinitrate to DPT. This scientific approach is considered as a bridge through which we aim to initiate a complete kinetic study of an important intermediate in the synthesis route of one of the most powerful energetic materials.",2019,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6db647623d46bf0b9bb4b36189aceb60c67226ee,Personalized medicine: the road ahead.,"With breast cancer now being recognized as a heterogeneous disease, the concept of personalized medicine demands that the tumor of every individual be treated uniquely. This has lead to ever-expanding use of existing prognostic and predictive markers, and the search for better ones is ongoing. The classic prognostic tools such as tumor size, lymph node status, grade, hormone receptors, and HER2 status are now supplemented by gene expression-based tools such as PAM50 and MammaPrint. However, the overdependence of these tools on proliferation-related genes is a significant handicap. Although pathway-based signatures hold great promise in future breast cancer prognostication, the fact that every tumor has multiple functional pathways significantly limits the utility of this approach. Developed by the integration of estrogen receptor (ER), HER2, proliferation-related, and other genes, the Oncotype DX assay has been able to provide valuable prognostic information for ER-positive tumors. Newer molecular markers based on cancer stem cells, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and miRNAs are becoming available, but their importance needs to be validated. It is clear that breast cancer is a multifaceted process and that none of the tools can reliably predict a binary outcome (recurrence or no recurrence). The breast cancer community is still awaiting an ideal prognostic tool that can integrate knowledge from classic variables such as tumor size and grade with new throughput technology and principles of pharmacogenomics. Such a tool will not only define prognostic subgroups but also be able to predict therapeutic efficacy and/or resistance based on molecular profiling.",2011,90,49,1,3,4,15,5,7,2,5,1,3,2

In PGE2 biosynthesis, cyclooxygenases (COX-1/COX-2) convert arachidonic acid to PGH2, which can be isomerized to PGE2 by microsomal PGE-synthase-1 (MPGES-1). The human prostate cancer cell line DU145 expressed high amounts of MPGES-1 in a constitutive manner. MPGES-1 expression also was detectable in human prostate cancer tissues, where it appeared more abundant compared with benign hyperplasia. By using shRNA, we established stable and practically complete knockdown of MPGES-1, both in DU145 cells with high constitutive expression and in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549, where MPGES-1 is inducible. For microsomes prepared from knockdown clones, conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 was reduced by 85–90%. This resulted in clear phenotypic changes: MPGES-1 knockdown conferred decreased clonogenic capacity and slower growth of xenograft tumors (with disintegrated tissue structure) in nude mice. For DU145 cells, MPGES-1 knockdown gave increased apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress (adriamycin), which could be rescued by exogenous PGE2. The results suggest that MPGES-1 is an alternative therapeutic target in cancer cells expressing this enzyme.",2009,34,93,4,0,7,8,13,11,5,8,4,6,8

As in other vertebrate species the nasal (anterior) field projected anterolaterally, and the inferior field posterolaterally. Values of magnification-1 (m-1, or degrees of visual field per millimeter tectal surface) were calculated over most of the tectum, for measurements in the coronal and sagittal planes. Whereas m-1 was fairly constant for measurement pairs in sagittal planes, for coronal planes there was a rather large, elongated, horizontally oriented area in the upper field of vision within which m-1 was smaller than elsewhere. In this area m-1 was anisotropic, with a ratio of almost 2:1 between sagittal and coronal planes. In a previously study we had observed that many cells recorded in deeper tectal layers responded to somatosensory stimulation, with whiskers especially conspicuous. In a given penetration perpendicular to the tectal surface, somatosensory receptive fields recorded in the deeper tectum were always concerned with that group of whiskers or with those parts of the body that crossed the regions of visual field represented in the superficial layers directly above. Given this information on the visual coordinates associated with certain somatosensory fields, the detailed mapping of the visual field onto the tectum made it possible to prepare a map of the somatosensory projection on the tectum. The resulting representation differed markedly from maps described for the classic somatosensory pathway. In the tectum the somatosensory map was dictated by the visual-field projection rather than by the peripheral tactile innervation density. Whiskers were thus featured much more prominently in the tectum, and structures close to the eye, such as the pinna and cheek, receive more representation than the tail or hindpaws.",1976,35,333,15,1,11,5,7,7,13,10,11,8,8

It was furthermore evident by the time these studies were initiated (1942), that there was an intimate relationship between folic acid (Lactobacillus casei factor) and purine and thymine l1 in which the former was believed to play an enzymatic role.1° This finding recalled earlier studies relating purines to the metabolism of p-aminobenzoic acid (pAB) by way of their effects on sulfonamide inhibition of microorganism^,'^-^^ although the role of pAB as a moiety of the folic acid molecule was not yet appreciated. It thus became apparent that a program of study of antimetabolites related to the purines and pyrimidines might profitably include provision for antifolic acid effects. In order to implement this study, a program of chemical synthesis and a reference biological system were established simultaneously. The choice of Lactobacillus casei as a biological system was based on the alternative nature of its folic acid or thymine-purine requirement. This characteristic allowed an analog to be tested for its ability to simulate or antagonize folic acid, thymine, and purines in a single test through use of a few variants of the same medium.” 2 , l6 This system served as a guide to the synthesis of analogs with the desired types of biochemical mechanisms of action, and as a reference system to which other biological systems could be compared. The availability of the chemical structure-biological activity pattern for this reference organism has greatly simplified the task of working out structure-activity correlation patterns for each of the succeeding biological systems which has been investigated. The program proposed a systematic study of the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity in order to determine the biochemical significance of each chemical feature. Each of the natural purine and pyrimidine bases has served as a starting point, and the significance of each atom has",1954,55,108,0,0,1,6,1,3,1,3,3,3,1

5fe5687512506b264f69b17447a8dd3ef39e4930,Evidence of Environmental Dependencies of Type Ia Supernovae from the Nearby Supernova Factory indicated by Local H$\alpha$,"Context. Use of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as distance indicators has proven to be a powerful technique for measuring the darkenergy equation of state. However, recent studies have highlighted potential biases correlated with the global properties of their host galaxies, large enough to induce systematic errors into such cosmological measurements if not properly treated. Aims. We study the host galaxy regions in close proximity to SNe Ia in order to analyze relations between the properties of SN Ia events and environments where their progenitors most likely formed. In this paper we focus on local H emission as an indicator of young progenitor environments. Methods. The Nearby Supernova Factory has obtained flux-calibrated spectral timeseries for SNe Ia using integral field spectroscopy. These observations enabled the simultaneous measurement of the SN and its immediate vicinity. For 89 SNe Ia we measured or set limits on H emission, used as a tracer of ongoing star formation, within a 1 kpc radius around each SN. This constitutes the first direct study of the local environment for a large sample of SNe Ia with accurate luminosity, color, and stretch measurements. Results. Our local star formation measurements provide several critical new insights. We find that SNe Ia with local H emission are redder by 0:036 0:017 mag, and that the previously noted correlation between stretch and host mass is driven entirely by the SNe Ia coming from locally passive environments, in particular at the low-stretch end. There is no such trend for SNe Ia in locally star-forming environments. Our most important finding is that the mean standardized brightness for SNe Ia with local H emission is 0:094 0:031 mag fainter on average than for those without. This o set arises from a bimodal structure in the Hubble residuals, with one mode being shared by SNe Ia in all environments and the other one exclusive to SNe Ia in locally passive environments. This structure also explains the previously known host-mass bias. We combine the star formation dependence of this bimodality with the cosmic star formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean SN Ia brightness and the host-mass bias. The strong change predicted is confirmed using high-redshift SNe Ia from the literature. Conclusions. The environmental dependences in SN Ia Hubble residuals and color found here point to remaining systematic errors in the standardization of SNe Ia. In particular, the observed brightness o set associated with local H emission is predicted to cause a significant bias in current measurements of the dark energy equation of state. Recognition of these e ects o ers new opportunities to improve SNe Ia as cosmological probes. For instance, we note that the SNe Ia associated with local H emission are more homogeneous, resulting in a brightness dispersion of only 0:105 0:012 mag.",2013,76,116,10,2,13,13,8,14,20,20,20,5,0
6d66681da9cac25a183fda77d18ca77ced598667,Discovery of the Transuranium Elements Inspired Rearrangement of the Periodic Table and the Approach for Finding New Elements,"The synthesis and characterization of transuranium elements played an important and in the history of the periodic table. Prior to their discovery, elements up to uranium were thought to be 6d elements, and in the late 1930s, they were placed in the periodic table as such. The discovery of neptunium and plutonium and the determination of their chemical properties suggested that valence electrons were entering 5f orbitals and represented the emergence of a new series in the periodic table. The original characterization of americium and curium failed, until it was realized that they may behave more like uranium and plutonium than transition elements. Glenn Seaborg introduced the actinide concept and proposed rearranging the periodic table to create a new 5f actinide series akin to the 4f lanthanide series. Due to imperfect screening of the 5f electrons, and the subsequent changes in the energetics of both the 5f and 6d orbitals as one progresses along the series, the actinides experience an actinide contraction and display a fascinating set of periodic trends. Moving from left to right, the valence 5f electrons contract and lose their ability to form chemical bonds. The crossover from bonding (itinerant) to ionic (magnetic) behavior gives rise to many exotic and interesting chemical and physical properties and has challenged modern approaches to electronic structure both in theory and experiment. The multiplicity of oxidation states, coupled with the hydrolysis behavior of the aqueous ions, makes the chemical behavior of protactinium through americium among the most complex of the elements in the periodic table.",2019,127,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Microcracks were observed during the growth of AlN; the GaN stripes then sublimated from the microcracks while keeping the AlN shell, resulting in void formation in the AlN shell structure. After GaN regrowth on this AlN shell structure, we successfully coalesced the GaN stripes to form a smooth, thick GaN layer having voids at the GaN/substrate interface. Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the residual tensile stress was decreased. The thermal stress decreased owing to the separation between the GaN layer and a foreign substrate.

After assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), AChRs must be transported to the plasma membrane through the secretory apparatus. Little is known about specific molecules that mediate this transport. Here we identify a gene that is required for subtype‐specific trafficking of assembled nicotinic AChRs in Caenorhabditis elegans. unc‐50 encodes an evolutionarily conserved integral membrane protein that localizes to the Golgi apparatus. In the absence of UNC‐50, a subset of AChRs present in body‐wall muscle are sorted to the lysosomal system and degraded. However, the trafficking of a second AChR type and of GABA ionotropic receptors expressed in the same muscle cells is not affected in unc‐50 mutants. These results suggest that, in addition to ER quality control, assembled AChRs are sorted within the Golgi system by a mechanism that controls the amount of cell‐surface AChRs in a subtype‐specific way.",2007,70,75,7,0,7,9,7,3,5,7,4,7,3

Here we describe a novel mitotic inhibitor that acts during Drosophila gastrulation to counteract String/Cdc25, specifically in the cells that invaginate to form the mesoderm. We have identified two genes, frühstart and tribbles, that are required for this ventral inhibition. tribbles encodes a kinase-related protein whose RNA, however, is also present outside of the ventral region. Effective inhibition of mitosis in the cells of the ventral furrow depends on the transcription factor Snail that triggers the ventral cell shape changes. When overexpressed in a microinjection assay, Tribbles directly inhibits mitosis. We propose that Frühstart and Tribbles form a link between the morphogenetic movements and mitotic control.",2000,61,329,13,2,10,14,14,14,13,11,20,12,14
d706b63d9bce696b39e0b157ee2730a30ba23a91,Sarcoplasmic reticulum adenosinetriphosphatase phosphorylation from inorganic phosphate. Theoretical and experimental reinvestigation.,"Pi phosphorylation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles in the absence of Ca was reinvestigated. Theoretical analysis shows that, for various substrate concentrations, the time dependence of phosphoenzyme formation does not allow determination of an unambiguous reaction scheme or estimation of the stoichiometry of the reaction. To overcome this difficulty, we measured medium Pi oxygen exchange, [32P]-phosphoenzyme formation, and intrinsic fluorescence. We found that contrarily to the usual assumption the substrate binding step in the phosphorylation direction at pH 6.0, KCl = 0, and 23 degrees C is a slow process whose bimolecular rate constant is around 5 X 10(3) M-1 s-1 for both Mg and Pi binding. We confirm [Lacapère, J. J., Gingold, M. P., Champeil, P., & Guillain, F. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2302-2306] that, in a second step, the establishment of a covalent bond between the bound Pi and the enzyme is formed with a rate constant greater than or equal to 20 s-1 whereas the dephosphorylation rate constant is 2-3 s-1. These results imply that under optimal conditions for phosphorylation, the enzyme is almost entirely phosphorylated at concentrations of 20 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM Pi. Study of the phosphorylation reaction under various experimental conditions shows that reduction of the phosphoenzyme level upon KCl addition is mainly due to the augmentation of the hydrolysis rate constant. In addition we propose that the strong inhibition by large amounts of MgCl2 is due to the formation of an E? .

The polarization propagates along the chain in the form of spin-wave packets that gradually split into sub-packets bouncing back and forth at the ends. The initially regular appearance turns at longer times into an erratic behavior due to the complex interference of the spin-wave packets.

A field trial involving 3 acres of graft-inoculated trees revealed some degree of protection afforded by Theobroma virus 1B against infection with virus 1A. The protection appeared to be more effective against insect inoculation than against graft transmission, being only temporary in the latter. Virus 1C (probably unrelated but not to be called Theobroma virus 2 until more evidence is available) conferred no protection against virus 1A. 
 
 
 
The latent periods for these viruses were calculated from this experiment, which also provided data on their effects on yield. Virus 1A reduced yield by 50% in the first year after inoculation and killed the trees in the second.

Only one primary reaction channel was observed, elimination of the halogen atom, with an average translational energy release of 33 kcal/mol. In the case of 2‐bromoethanol, some of the C2 H4 OH partner fragment survived and some underwent secondary dissociation to produce C2 H4 and OH. The surviving C2 H4 OH contained up to 43 kcal/mol of internal energy, far more than the expected C2 H4 ‐OH bond energy of ∼28 kcal/mol. The initial C–Br recoil occurs with a large exit impact parameter and leaves most of the internal energy in C2 H4 OH rotation, creating rotationally metastable fragments. The angular distributions of the secondary C2 H4 and OH products were strongly forward–backward peaked with respect to the primary (C2 H4 OH) velocity vector, consistent with the decay of a long‐lived complex in which the total angular momentum is perpendicular to the velocity vector and mainly carried away as orbital angular momentum....",1990,12,53,0,1,1,3,2,6,1,3,2,3,8

Establishment of these connections is believed to require signals secreted from outgrowing axons, followed by synapse formation between selected neurons. Deletion of a single protein, Munc18-1, in mice leads to a complete loss of neurotransmitter secretion from synaptic vesicles throughout development. However, this does not prevent normal brain assembly, including formation of layered structures, fiber pathways, and morphologically defined synapses. After assembly is completed, neurons undergo apoptosis, leading to widespread neurodegeneration. Thus, synaptic connectivity does not depend on neurotransmitter secretion, but its maintenance does. Neurotransmitter secretion probably functions to validate already established synaptic connections.",2000,40,1247,60,30,50,57,60,58,61,78,75,65,58

It is now possible to quantify the low levels of telomerase activity in human leukocytes. Low basal telomerase activity has been related to chronic stress in people and to chronic glucocorticoid exposure in vitro. Here we test whether leukocyte telomerase activity changes under acute psychological stress. We exposed 44 elderly women, including 22 high stress dementia caregivers and 22 matched low stress controls, to a brief laboratory psychological stressor, while examining changes in telomerase activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). At baseline, caregivers had lower telomerase activity levels than controls, but during stress telomerase activity increased similarly in both groups. Across the entire sample, subsequent telomerase activity increased by 18% one hour after the end of the stressor (p<0.01). The increase in telomerase activity was independent of changes in numbers or percentages of monocytes, lymphocytes, and specific T cell types, although we cannot fully rule out some potential contribution from immune cell redistribution in the change in telomerase activity. Telomerase activity increases were associated with greater cortisol increases in response to the stressor. Lastly, psychological response to the tasks (greater threat perception) was also related to greater telomerase activity increases in controls. These findings uncover novel relationships of dynamic telomerase activity with exposure to an acute stressor, and with two classic aspects of the stress response - perceived psychological stress and neuroendocrine (cortisol) responses to the stressor.",2010,65,185,10,4,12,17,18,23,21,14,20,19,19

7e1724586e7315c383f8ac6008da1dd1fd6fd22f,Evolution of Binary Compact Objects That Merge,"Beginning from massive binaries in the Galaxy, we evolve black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries and binary neutron stars, such as the Hulse-Taylor system PSR 1913+16. The new point in our evolution is a quantitative calculation of the accretion of matter by a neutron star in a common-envelope evolution that sends it into a black hole. We calculate the mass of the latter to be ~2.4 M☉. The black hole fate of the first neutron star can only be avoided if the neutron star does not go through common-envelope evolution. This can be realized if the two massive binaries are sufficiently close in mass, not more than ~5% apart, so that they burn helium at the same time. Then their common hydrogen envelope is expelled by the tightening in the double He star system, with attendant hydrodynamical coupling to the envelope. In this way, we obtain a rate of 10-5 per yr per galaxy for production of the narrow neutron star binaries, such as Hulse-Taylor 1913+16 or Wolszczan 1934+12. This is in agreement with estimates based on the observed number of such systems extrapolated to the entire Galaxy, with beaming factors and corrections for the ~90% of binary pulsars estimated to be unobservable. Our chief conclusion is that the production rate for BH-NS binaries (in which the neutron star is unrecycled) is ~10-4 per yr per galaxy, an order of magnitude greater than that of neutron star binaries. Not only should this result in a factor of ~10 more mergings for gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, but the signal should also be larger. We include some discussion of why BH-NS binaries have not been observed, but conclude that they should be actively searched for.",1998,21,209,12,6,19,14,8,9,6,9,13,15,6

The scale of both exponential and oscillating dependencies corresponds to the scale of the interface roughness and can reach 20–30 nm. The oscillating variation of the field makes 90° alignment of the magnetization energetically favorable in analogy to the Slonczewski’s mechanism.

Analysis revealed that this protein is very similar in structure to the chicken neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule, Ng-CAM, and to mouse L1. cDNA clones encompassing the entire coding sequence of this Ng-CAM related molecule, called Nr- CAM, have been isolated and sequenced. A glycoprotein containing one major component of Mr 145,000 on SDS-PAGE was purified from brain by lentil lectin affinity chromatography and FPLC, and its amino-terminal sequence was identical to that predicted from the Nr-CAM cDNA. The complete cDNA sequence encodes six Ig-like domains, five fibronectin type III repeats, a predicted transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain. On Northern blots, nucleic acid probes for Nr-CAM recognized one major RNA species of approximately 7 kb and much lesser amounts of larger RNAs. Most of the same probes hybridized to single bands on genomic Southern blots, suggesting that Nr-CAM is encoded by a single gene that may be alternatively processed to yield several mRNAs. In support of this notion, two Nr-CAM cDNA clones had a 57-bp sequence located between the second and third Ig-like domains that was not found in two other Nr-CAM cDNA clones, and two other clones were isolated that lacked the 279-bp segment encoding the fifth fibronectin-like type III repeat. Antibodies against the purified protein and synthetic peptides in Nr-CAM both recognized a predominant Mr 145,000 species and a much less prevalent species of Mr 170,000 in neural tissues. Levels of Nr-CAM expression increased in the brain until approximately embryonic day (E) 12, followed by slightly lower levels of expression at E18 and after hatching. Immunofluorescent staining with anti-Nr-CAM antibodies showed that most neurons in the retina were positive at E7 and the pattern of expression became restricted to several layers on neuronal cell bodies and fibers during development. Anti-Nr-CAM antibodies labeled specifically cell surfaces on neurons in culture. Although the structure of Nr-CAM resembles that of chicken Ng-CAM and mouse L1, the identity with each of these neural CAMs does not exceed 40%. The differences indicate that Nr-CAM is distinct from Ng-CAM and L1, but there are sufficient similarities to suggest that all of these molecules are members of a subgroup of neural CAMs in the N-CAM superfamily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1991,114,184,11,5,15,8,13,17,16,12,13,4,9

Twelve additional cases with various diffuse diseases of the lungs characterized physiologically principally by interference with the diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar-capillary septum have been studied. 2.2. The patients in this group included two with pulmonary granulomatosis following exposure to beryllium; one with pulmonary granulomatosis of the Boeck's sarcoid type; one with pulmonary granulomatosis of undetermined etiology, in which the granulomatous lesion contained unusually large numbers of foreign body-type giant cells and bi-refractile crystals; one patient with scleroderma; three patients with pulmonary fibrosis of unknown etiology (in one case after exposure to beryllium, in two cases associated with granulomas in other organs), and four cases in which a diagnosis could not be made. 3.3. The pattern of pulmonary dysfunction consisted of (1) reduced lung volumes, (2) maintenance of a large maximum breathing capacity, (3) hyperventilation at rest and during exercise, (4) normal or nearly normal arterial oxygen saturation at rest but a marked reduction of the arterial oxygen saturation after exercise, (5) normal alveolar oxygen tension, (6) a reduced oxygen diffusing capacity and (7) pulmonary artery hypertension. 4.4. In some severe cases the dead space-like ventilation and the venous admixture-like perfusion was increased.

The involvement of RNA is very much more complicated than was imagined in 1953. There is not one functional RNA. Instead, protein synthesis demands the ordered interaction of three classes of RNA—ribosomal, soluble, and messenger. Many important questions, however, remain unanswered. For instance, there is no theoretical framework for the ribosomal subunits, nor for that matter, do we understand the functional significance of ribosomal RNA. Most satisfying is the realization that all the steps in protein replication will be shown to involve well-understood chemical forces. As yet we do not know all the details. For example, are the DNA base pairs involved in messenger RNA selection of the corresponding amino-acyl-sRNA? With luck, this will soon be known. We can thus have every expectation that future progress in understanding selective protein synthesis (and its consequences for embryology) will have a similarly well-defined and, when understood, easy-to-comprehend chemical basis (62).",1963,64,203,1,12,22,23,22,15,4,13,6,6,2

It can be synthesized in various forms by both nerve and muscle and it becomes concentrated at the motor endplate. Biochemical analysis of a frog muscle extract enriched in basal lamina revealed the presence of a polydisperse, polysialylated form of N-CAM with an average Mr of approximately 160,000 as determined by SDS-PAGE, which was converted to a form of 125,000 Mr by treatment with neuraminidase. To define further the role of N-CAM in neuromuscular junction organization, we studied the distribution of N-CAM in an in vivo preparation of frog basal lamina sheaths obtained by inducing the degeneration of both nerve and muscle fibers. Immunoreactive material could be readily detected by anti-N-CAM antibodies in such basal lamina sheaths. Ultrastructural analysis using immunogold techniques revealed N-CAM in close association with the basal lamina sheaths, present in dense accumulation at places that presumably correspond to synaptic regions. N-CAM epitopes were also associated with collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix. The ability of anti-N-CAM antibodies to perturb nerve regeneration and reinnervation of the remaining basal lamina sheaths was then examined. In control animals, myelinating Schwann cells wrapped around the regenerated axon and reinnervation occurred only at the old synaptic areas; new contacts between nerve and basal lamina had a terminal Schwann cell capping the nerve terminal. In the presence of anti-N-CAM antibodies, three major abnormalities were observed in the regeneration and reinnervation processes: (a) regenerated axons in nerve trunks that had grown back into the old Schwann cell basal lamina were rarely associated with myelinating Schwann cell processes, (b) ectopic synapses were often present, and (c) many of the axon terminals lacked a terminal Schwann cell capping the nerve-basal lamina contact area. These results suggest that N-CAM may play an important role not only in the determination of synaptic areas but also in Schwann cell-axon interactions during nerve regeneration.",1988,38,82,3,0,7,8,7,12,1,3,9,5,5
9839f57ece52abe381aab29e48f19ce6de07755a,Combined TP53 mutation/3p loss correlates with decreased radiosensitivity and increased matrix-metalloproteinase activity in head and neck carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE
Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) containing TP53 mutation and 3p deletion (""double-hit"") have poorer prognosis compared to patients with either event alone (""single-hit""). The etiology for worse clinical outcomes in patients with ""double-hit"" cancers is unclear. We compared radiosensitivity of cell lines containing both TP53 mutations and deletion of Fragile Histidine Triad (FHIT, the gene most commonly associated with 3p deletion) to ""single-hit"" lines with only TP53 mutation. We compared radiosensitivity in a ""single-hit"" cell line with TP53 mutation converted to ""double-hit"" using RNA interference targeting FHIT. Finally, we compared matrixmetalloproteinase-2/9 (MMP-2/9) activity, a previously-established biomarker for tumor aggressiveness, in xenograft tumors derived from these cell lines.


MATERIALS/METHODS
TP53 mutation and FHIT deletion profiles of HNSCC lines were established using Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). We used RNA-interference to convert a ""single-hit"" cell line (SCC4) to ""double-hit"". Cultured cells were examined for radiosensitivity and cisplatin sensitivity. MMP-2/9 activity was evaluated in ""double-hit"" versus ""single-hit"" tumors using ratiometric activatable cell-penetrating peptide (RACPP) in tongue (n=17) and flank xenografts (n=4).


RESULTS
Radiotherapy caused greater double-stranded DNA breaks in ""single-hit"" vs naturally occurring and engineered ""double-hit"" cells. In-vivo, ""double-hit"" xenografts demonstrated higher MMP-2/9 activity compared to ""single-hit"" xenografts (p<0.01). There was no difference in cisplatin sensitivity between the cell lines.


CONCLUSIONS
TP53 mutation combined with FHIT deletion correlates with decreased radiosensitivity in HNC cell lines. Xenograft from ""double-hit"" cells exhibit increased MMP-2/9 activity. These findings may in part account for the worse clinical outcome seen in patients with HNSCC ""double-hit"" tumors.",2015,20,17,0,0,7,2,3,3,2,0,0,0,0

These include extended versions of the U(N) Gross-Neveu model, the non-linear O(N) $\sigma$-model, and the $CP^{N-1}$ model. Although these models are not renormalizable in the usual sense, the infinite number of coupling types allows a complete cancellation of infinities. These models provide qualitative predictions of the form of scattering amplitudes for arbitrary momenta, but because of the infinite number of free parameters, it is possible to derive quantitative predictions only in the limit of small momenta. For small momenta the large-$N$ limit provides only a modest simplification, removing at most a finite number of diagrams to each order in momenta, except near phase transitions, where it reduces the infinite number of diagrams that contribute for low momenta to a finite number.",1997,13,28,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,2,1,1,1

Intact protein is presented best by immature, epidermal Langerhans cells","The capacity of dendritic cells to present protein antigens has been studied with two MHC class II-restricted, myoglobin-specific, T cell clones. Spleen dendritic cells and cultured epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) presented native myoglobin weakly and often not at all. These same populations were powerful stimulators of allogeneic T cells in the primary MLR. Freshly isolated LC were in contrast very active in presenting proteins to T cell clones but were weak stimulators of the MLR. Both fresh and cultured LC could present specific peptide fragments of myoglobin to the clones. These results suggest that dendritic cells in nonlymphoid tissues like skin can act as sentinels for presenting antigens in situ, their accessory function developing in two phases. First antigens are captured and appropriately presented. Further handling of antigen then is downregulated while the cells acquire strong sensitizing activity for the growth and function of resting T lymphocytes. The potent MLR stimulating activity of cultured epidermal LC and lymphoid dendritic cells probably reflects prior handling of antigens leading to the formation of allogeneic MHC-peptide complexes.",1989,40,530,15,5,20,16,27,27,14,28,32,26,29

The virus-specific RNA, detected by hybridization. In RNA excess with complementary DNA, was reduced by approximately 70-100 fold in cytoplasm of resistant cells compared to permissive cells. A reduction of the same magnitude was observed in the levels of virus-specific RNA extracted from nuclei of resistant cells. Our data therefore show that virus-specific RNA levels are reduced in cells nonpermissive at the Fv-1 locus, suggesting that restriction of the Fv-1 gene product occurs at the level of transcription of the viral genome or at a pre-integration step, or, alternatively, that the RNA transcripts are rapidly degraded after their synthesis.",1976,27,45,0,2,10,5,1,5,3,0,3,0,0

Splice variants (SVs) of receptors for GHRH have been found in several human cancers and cancer cell lines. The antiproliferative actions of GHRH antagonists could be mediated in part through these SVs of GHRH receptors. In this study we examined the expression of mRNA for GHRH and SVs of its receptors in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MCF-7MIII, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-468, and T47D. mRNA for GHRH was present in all lines tested. mRNA for SV1 isoform of GHRH receptors was found in MCF-7MIII, MDA-MB-468, and T47D; and for SV2 isoform in MCF-7MIII and T47D cell lines. In proliferation studies in vitro, the growth of T47D cells was stimulated by GHRH and dose-dependently inhibited by GHRH antagonist JV-1-38. H89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), bisindolylmaleimide I (protein kinase C [PKC] inhibitor) and verapamil (voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker) inhibited the GHRH-stimulated proliferation of T47D cells. The GHRH antagonist JV-1-38 suppressed the T47D cell growth in vitro stimulated by PKC activator (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate). The stimulation of T47D cells by GHRH was followed by an increase in cAMP production and GHRH antagonist JV-1-38 competitively inhibited this effect. Our results suggest that SVs of GHRH receptors could mediate the responses to GHRH and GHRH antagonists in breast cancer through Ca2+-, cAMP- and PKC-dependent mechanisms. The presence of SV1 of GHRH receptors in human cancers provides a rationale for antitumor therapy based on the blockade of this receptor by specific GHRH antagonists.",2004,51,59,2,4,8,5,2,5,6,3,1,2,5
9999c7a98a13988a09702a27876f30fb3a81b892,A reporter gene to analyse the hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes.,"The affinity maturation of antibodies is driven by somatic hypermutation which is localized to specific segments of the coding genes. The information available on this process derives from studies in vivo. With the intention of developing new approaches, we have constructed a fusion gene between a kappa chain and a selectable neomycin resistance gene, neor. The neor gene, which includes the SV40 small t intron and polyadenylation site, but not the upstream elements nor its first 12 amino acids, is an in-frame substitution of the FR2-CDR3 fragment of a rearranged V kappa OX1-J kappa 5 gene. Expression of neor activity is therefore dependent on the upstream immunoglobulin sequence. A stop codon was placed in the CDR1 region so that only mutants survive treatment with geneticin sulphate (G418). The effectiveness of the system was tested by transfecting the NS0 myeloma cell line and isolating spontaneous mutants. Neomycin-resistant clones arose at an estimated rate of 1 x 10(-8)/cell division, and over 90% were authentic structural mutants. Unlike the somatic hypermutations, the majority arose by in-frame deletions including the stop codon, although up to 30% involved a point mutation. The reporter gene was then modified by substituting all the sequences downstream of the J kappa 5 with others known to be required for full hypermutation in vivo. Different cell lines were transfected and G418-resistant clones analyzed. No significant increase in the rate of reversion or in the generation of point mutations versus deletions was detected, even using conditioned culture medium. In the presence of azacytidine however, a mutant involving multiple events (single base addition and deletion plus two point mutations) was detected. The reporter gene system therefore seems suitable to test culture conditions and modifications of the host cells aimed at the derivation of an in vitro assay of somatic hypermutation.",1995,0,15,0,1,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,1,1

The structure consists of six alpha-helices, which are arranged in a globular fold that encapsulates a central helix alpha7 formed by the C-terminal polypeptide segment 131-142. The 3D arrangement of these helices is anchored by the three disulfide bonds 19-54, 50-108 and 97-117, which were identified by NMR. Superposition of the ApolPBP1A structure with the structure of the homologous pheromone-binding protein of Bombyx mori at pH 4.5, BmorPBPA, yielded an rmsd of 1.7 A calculated for the backbone heavy-atoms N, Calpha and C' of residues 10-142. In contrast, the present ApolPBP1A structure is different from a recently proposed molecular model for a low-pH form of ApolPBP1 that does not contain the central helix alpha7. ApolPBP1 exhibits a pH-dependent transition between two different globular conformations in slow exchange on the NMR chemical shift timescale similar to BmorPBP, suggesting that the two proteins use the same mechanism of ligand binding and ejection. The extensive sequence homology observed for pheromone-binding proteins from moth species further implies that the previously proposed mechanism of ligand ejection involving the insertion of a C-terminal helix into the pheromone-binding site is a general feature of pheromone signaling in moths.",2007,25,82,3,0,1,10,5,6,8,11,4,6,4

The technique provides a validity test on the pattern search of cosmic strings that could serve as the groundwork for future pattern searches. The detecting power of the technique is only constrained by two unavoidable features of CMB data: (1) the finite pixelization of the sky map and (2) the Gaussian fluctuation from instrumental noise and primordial anisotropy. We set the upper limit on the cosmic string parameter as Gμ 1.6 × 10-5 at the 95% confidence level (CL) and find that the amplitude of the temperature step has to be greater than 44 μK in order to be detected for the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 3 year data.,2006,10,22,3,0,5,3,4,4,1,0,0,0,2

The attachment of Apg12p, a modifier with no significant similarity to ubiquitin, to Apg5p is crucial for autophagy in yeast. This reaction proceeds in a ubiquitination‐like manner, and requires Apg7p and Apg10p. Apg7p exhibits a considerable similarity to ubiquitin‐activating enzyme (E1) and is found to activate Apg12p with ATP hydrolysis. Apg10p, on the other hand, shows no significant similarity to other proteins whose functions are known. Here, we show that after activation by Apg7p, Apg12p is transferred to the Cys‐133 residue of Apg10p to form an Apg12p–Apg10p thioester. Cells expressing Apg10pC133S do not generate the Apg12p–Apg5p conjugate, which leads to defects in autophagy and cytoplasm‐to‐vacuole targeting of aminopeptidase I. These findings indicate that Apg10p is a new type of protein‐conjugating enzyme that functions in the Apg12p–Apg5p conjugation pathway.",1999,65,292,18,2,13,14,14,13,11,8,3,12,14

For group III nitrides, pulsed-mode growth has recently been reported as an effective method for growing nanorod arrays with geometric precision. Here, we demonstrated the growth of arrays of highly elongated nanorods on Si substrates by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition using a pulsed-mode approach. Unlike the thick and high (or middle)-quality GaN templates normally used, nanorod growth was performed on an ultrathin and low-quality AlN/Si platform. Using kinetically controlled growth conditions and a patterning process, exceptionally long GaN nanorods were achieved with high geometric precision. The grown nanorods showed considerably improved optical and structural properties while remaining in uniform arrays. This approach can be used with a variety of materials to obtain nanorods with high quality, high uniformity, and high aspect ratio, and it can also serve as an effective fabrication method for InAlGaN-alloyed core/shell nanostructures for optoelectronic nanodevices with ultrahigh efficiency.",2016,47,27,0,3,5,7,5,4,3,0,0,0,0

(A more complete record of this survey as of January 1, 1933, has been published in Phys. Rev., v. 43, 387, 1933.) Previous studies of the relative intensity of the cosmic rays in different parts of the world have been made by J. Clay (J. Clay, Amsterdam, Proc. Akad. Wet., v. 30, 1115, 1927, and v. 31, 1091, 1928), who made several trips between Java and Holland, and who found consistently a lower intensity near the equator; Millikan and Cameron (R. A. Millikan and G. H. Cameron, Phys. Rev., v. 31, 163, 1928), who found but small and doubtful differences between Bolivia and California in their measurements in mountain lakes, and no difference (R. A. Millikan, Phys. Rev., v. 36, 1595, 1930) between Pasadena and Churchill, close to the north magnetic pole; Bothe and Kolhorster (W. Bothe and W. Kolhorster, Berlin, SitzBer. Akad.

Corlin, Lund Medd., No. 121, 1930), who on going from 50° north to 70° north in Scandinavia found some evidence of a maximum at about 55° north. The prevailing opinion regarding the significance of these measurements has thus been expressed by Hoffmann (G. Hoffmann, Physik. Zs., v. 32, 633, 1932. Hoffmann mentions also—without reference—that in their airship-flight over the north pole Malmgren and Behounek observed the normal cosmic-ray intensity throughout the flight.) in a recent summary, “The results so far have on the whole been negative.

We now report that VSV glycoprotein G (gpG) is essential for the induction of a previously unrecognized CD14/TLR4-dependent response pathway in which the adapter TRAM has predominant importance, absent any need for MyD88 or Mal, and with only a partial requirement for TRIF. Downstream of TRAM, IRF7 activation leads to a type I IFN response. The pathway is utilized by myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and macrophages rather than plasmacytoid DCs.

Short and broad of back, this character seldom went unnoticed. His squarish head, his blue eyes beneath blond brows, enormous, hirsute, shaggy, he ressembled certain Dutch portraits – a real Franz Hals! But behind his slightly sarcastic manner and even devilish aspect, his smile revealed a child's face. Born in South Africa, he had settled in Cambridge University's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, already home of Fred Sanger, Max Perutz, John Kendrew and Francis Crick. A beautiful string of prima donnas into which Sydney fitted perfectly.As soon as he appeared on the scene, Sydney took part in almost every advance in molecular biology. He was involved in the establishment of colinearity between gene and protein, in the demonstrations of the triplet nature of the genetic code, in the discovery of messenger RNA. And when he decided to switch from bacteria to metazoa, he ‘invented’ the nematode, a small worm of which he analysed both genetics and anatomy. As quick with his mind as with his hands, he was interested in everything. In addition, he had a good sense of humour, which could sometimes turn to nasty wittiness.Scientists’ autobiographies are a special kind of literature, for scientists can rarely bring themselves to discuss personal matters. They describe an orderly train of concepts and experiments that they have carefully purified from all affective and irrational dross. They get rid of any personal scent, any human smell. Very few scientists – Jim Watson, Max Perutz – dare to write a piece on life that is not restricted to work. Scientists spend most of their life in puzzlement and doubt. Yet they describe their work as a straightforward achievement, a victorious march from darkness to light. In reality, they hesitate, stumble, feel their way, question themselves constantly. They go from hope to disappointment, from exaltation to melancholy, always wondering whether they will emerge from the dark. Scientists write mainly for their fellow scientists and, above all, for historians of science. Historians of science, however, mistrust scientists’ autobiographies. They know that two scientists telling the same piece of history will not tell exactly the same story.Like many of his collegues, Sydney Brenner has written his ‘scientific life’. He dissects and recalls with great care his major achievements and the steps he took to get to them. What I find most revealing in his account is the less scientific part; that is, the beginning of his life and the way he came to science. It is the story of a young Jewish boy, the son of Lithuanian emigrants who lived in a small town of South Africa. It is of the hard time he endured at school, where his small size attracted a lot of teasing and rough play. He said of himself, ‘I grew up to be a professional coward. I would agree to anything not to get bullied’. But the exceptional talents of this small boy were soon recognized. He decided to become a scientist, and the beginning of the book describes how this remarkable boy became one of the most successful biologists of the century. The book is clearly and simply written. It is difficult to resist the fantastic drive and the intelligence of its leading figure.",2002,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We found that an extensive sampling is essential for obtaining converging results. This requirement points towards possible problems with approaches that use a limited conformational sampling. However, performing the proper sampling appears to give encouraging results and to offer a powerful tool for the computer‐aided design of enantioselective enzymes.

The experimentally measured crack propagation histories are used as input data to the so-called generation phase simulations to determine the dynamic stress intensity factor histories.

In most previous studies, the ratios of desorbed ions and neutrals from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) were measured outside the common MALDI conditions. In this work, we measured the ratios under common MALDI conditions.


METHODS
Ions were detected using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer in combination with a time-gated ion imaging detector. Mass-resolved desorbed neutral molecules at different angles and velocities were measured using a modified crossed molecular beam apparatus.


RESULTS
The upper limit of the ion-to-neutral ratio from pure 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (25DHB) is 4 × 10(-9) at laser fluence 40 J/m(2), it increases to 3 × 10(-7) at laser fluence 250 J/m(2). The ratios of matrix from the mixture of 25DHB and analyte remain in the same order of magnitude as pure 25DHB. However, the ratio of analyte depends strongly on the analyte. Values as large as 10(-3)-10(-4) for bradykinin and as small as <10(-8) for glycine were observed at laser fluence ~100 J/m(2).


CONCLUSION
The ion-to-neutral ratios of 25DHB matrix measured in this work are much smaller than some of the values reported in previous work using different methods and/or under different MALDI conditions.",2013,27,31,0,1,10,4,6,4,3,1,2,0,0

316615549110b273cd20463b82b82e2ec08e889d,The discovery of asymptotic freedom and the emergence of QCD.,"T he progress of science is much more muddled than is depicted in most history books. This is especially true of theoretical physics, partly because history is written by the victorious. Consequently, historians of science often ignore the many alternate paths that people wandered down, the many false clues they followed, the many misconceptions they had. These alternate points of view are less clearly developed than the final theories, harder to understand and easier to forget, especially as these are viewed years later, when it all really does make sense. Thus, reading history one rarely gets the feeling of the true nature of scientific development, in which the element of farce is as great as the element of triumph.

The emergence of QCD is a wonderful example of the evolution from farce to triumph. During a very short period, a transition occurred from experimental discovery and theoretical confusion to theoretical triumph and experimental confirmation. In this Nobel lecture, I shall describe the turn of events that led to the discovery of asymptotic freedom, which in turn led to the formulation of QCD, the final element of the remarkably comprehensive theory of elementary particle physics—the Standard Model. I shall then briefly describe the experimental tests of the theory and the implications of asymptotic freedom.

The early 1960s, when I started my graduate studies at UC Berkeley, were a period of experimental supremacy and theoretical impotence. The construction and utilization of major accelerators were proceeding at full steam. Experimental discoveries and surprises appeared every few months. There was hardly any theory to speak of. The emphasis was on phenomenology, and there were only small islands of theoretical advances here and there. Field theory was in disgrace; S-Matrix theory was in full bloom. Symmetries were all of the rage. Of the four forces …",2005,59,28,1,2,0,0,1,1,0,3,1,1,1

In contrast to previous investigations we have found the dissociation to proceed via a stepwise mechanism involving multiple reaction channels. The primary dissociation, S–C bond cleavage to eliminate a methyl radical, was found to have two competing channels with distinct translational energy distributions. The translational energy distribution for the major primary dissociation channel suggests that it proceeds in a statistical manner on the ground electronic surface following internal conversion. In competition with this channel is a primary dissociation that exhibits a translational energy distribution suggestive of dissociation on an excited electronic surface with most of the available energy partitioned into translational and electronic degrees of freedom. Secondary decomposition of the CD3SO intermediate was found to proceed exclusively via C–S bond cleavage, CD3SO→CD3+SO. However, secondary decomposition of the CH3SO intermediate was found to exhibit competition between CH3SO→CH3+SO and CH3SO→CH2SO+H. The dissociation to CH3 and SO was the major secondary decomposition channel with the translational energy distribution indicating a barrier to recombination of >8 kcal/mol. While a minor hydrogen atom elimination channel was found to play a role in secondary decomposition of CH3SO intermediates, no analogous secondary C–D bond cleavage was detected from the CD3SO intermediates indicating the importance of tunneling in the secondary decomposition of CH3SO.",1997,7,26,0,2,3,2,0,1,1,0,1,0,0

Because of the absence of effective treatment in the advanced stages of the disease, amputation is undertaken to alleviate unbearable symptoms. Since tissue ischemia and hypercholesterolemia are associated with an overwhelming generation of oxygen radicals, metabolic intervention with antioxidants and l-arginine can induce beneficial effects beyond those achieved by a novel therapeutic approach represented by the use of autologous bone marrow cells (BMCs).

No cDNAs for this class of proteins have been isolated to date. In the current paper, we report the isolation of a cDNA clone for the LDL receptor from a bovine adrenal cDNA library. The library was constructed by the Okayama-Berg method from poly(A)+ RNA that had been enriched in receptor mRNA by immunopurification of polysomes. Mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the amino acid sequence of two neighboring regions of a single cyanogen bromide fragment were used as hybridization probes to identify a recombinant plasmid containing the LDL receptor cDNA.

dff59e52bc6ade3498f97e611960c147b40e8cc8,Tadalafil: Protective Action against the Development of Multiple Organ Failure Syndrome,"Introduction Multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS) is a pathology associated to unspecified and severe trauma, characterized by elevated morbidity and mortality. The complex inflammatory MOFS-related reactions generate important ischemia-reperfusion responses in the induction of this syndrome. Nitric oxide elevation, through the activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), has the potential of counteracting the typical systemic vasoconstriction, and platelet-induced hypercoagulation. Tadalafil would possibly act protectively by reducing cGMP degradation with consequent diffuse vasodilatation, besides reduction of platelet-induced hypercoagulation, thus, preventing multiple organ failure syndrome development. Methods The experimental protocol was previously approved by an institution animal research committee. Experimental MOFS was induced through the stereotaxic micro-neurosurgical bilateral anterior hypothalamic lesions model. Groups of 10 Wistar rats were divided into: a) Non-operated control; b) Operated control group; c) 2 hours after tadalafil-treated operated group; d) 4 hours after tadalafil-treated operated group; e) 8 hours after post-treated operated group. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the neurosurgical procedure and submitted to histopathologic examination of five organs: brain, lungs, stomach, kidneys, and liver. Results The electrolytic hypothalamic lesions resulted in a full picture of MOFS with disseminated multiple-organs lesions, provoked primarily by diffusely spread micro-thrombi. The treatment with tadalafil 2 hours after the micro-neurosurgical lesions reduced the experimental MOFS lesions development, in a highly significant level (P<0.01) of 58.75%. The treatment with tadalafil, 4 hours after the micro-neurosurgically-induced MOFS lesions, also reduced in 49.71%, in a highly significant level (P<0.01). Finally, the treatment with tadalafil 8 hours after the neurosurgical procedure resulted in a statistically significant reduction of 30.50% (P<0.05) of the experimentally-induced MOFS gravity scores. Conclusion The phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, tadalafil, in the doses and timing utilized, showed to protect against the experimentally-induced MOFS.",2017,35,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With the objective of testing whether increased mtDNA mutations exacerbate the diabetic phenotype, we have compared mice heterozygous for the Akita diabetogenic mutation (Akita) with mice homozygous for the D257A mutation in mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (Polg) or with mice having both mutations (Polg-Akita). The Polg-D257A protein is defective in proofreading and increases mtDNA mutations. At 3 mo of age, the Polg-Akita and Akita male mice were equally hyperglycemic. Unexpectedly, as the Polg-Akita males aged to 9 mo, their diabetic symptoms decreased. Thus, their hyperglycemia, hyperphagia and urine output declined significantly. The decrease in their food intake was accompanied by increased plasma leptin and decreased plasma ghrelin, while hypothalamic expression of the orexic gene, neuropeptide Y, was lower and expression of the anorexic gene, proopiomelanocortin, was higher. Testis function progressively worsened with age in the double mutants, and plasma testosterone levels in 9-mo-old Polg-Akita males were significantly reduced compared with Akita males. The hyperglycemia and hyperphagia returned in aged Polg-Akita males after testosterone administration. Hyperglycemia-associated distal tubular damage in the kidney also returned, and Polg-D257A-associated proximal tubular damage was enhanced. The mild diabetes of female Akita mice was not affected by the Polg-D257A mutation.

The number of lipoprotein receptors, and hence the efficiency of disposal of plasma cholesterol, can be increased by cholesterol-lowering drugs.

It is shown by chromatographic analysis that irradiation of DNA in neutral solution generates the ring-saturated forms cis-thymine glycol, trans-thymine glycol, and a monohydroxydihydrothymine, probably 6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymine. The latter compound is only observed after irradiation under hypoxic conditions. The ring-contracted thymine derivative 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin is also formed, and it is the major lesion after irradiation of DNA under O2. Ring-fragmented products such as methyltartronylurea were only generated in small quantities.

The cleavage occurs at the ribosomal decoding A-site between nucleotides A1493 and G1494. The breaking of this single phosphodiester bond results in a complete termination of protein biosynthesis leading to cell death. A model structure of the complex of the ribosomal subunit 30S and colicin E3 was constructed by means of a new weighted-geometric docking algorithm, in which interactions involving specified parts of the molecular surface can be up-weighted, allowing incorporation of experimental data in the docking search. Our model, together with available experimental data, predicts the role of the catalytic residues of colicin E3.

A new method of analysis was used: in this method a mixture of normal and density-labeled (5-bromouracil or 15N) DNA's is incubated under conditions where λDNA dimers and trimers are formed. Then equilibrium sedimentation in a cesium chloride gradient is used to show whether mixed dimers and trimers have been formed. The method determines whether the DNA's from two different phages form mixed dimers, and whether a DNA has one but not two cohesive sites. Also it gives the relative molecular weights of the two DNA's, provided they do form mixed dimers. The DNA's from phages 424, 434 and 21, which recombine genetically with λ, have cohesive sites like those of λ. pH dissociation curves of λ:λ(BU)† and 21:λ(BU) dimers fail to show any difference in the stability of the two dimers, which indicates that the cohesive sites of 21 and λDNA are very similar. There is a striking difference in the pH dissociation behavior of λ:λ(BU) and λ:λ(15N) dimers, which suggests that the cohesive sites contain one or more AT base pairs. The DNA's from phages 186 and 299, which do not recombine with λ, do not form mixed dimers with λDNA. However, 186 DNA may have another type of cohesive site, since a mixture of normal and 15N-labeled 186 DNA's will form mixed dimers. The DNA's from two virulent λ phages have cohesive sites like those of normal λDNA. This is true also of the DNA from the deletion mutant λb2.",1966,30,83,2,2,3,7,8,4,4,11,7,5,2

These components include a recognition unit or receptor (for example, the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) for catecholamines or the 'light receptor' rhodopsin), a guanine nucleotide regulatory or transducing protein, and an effector enzyme (for example, adenylate cyclase or cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase). Molecular cloning has revealed that the beta AR shares significant sequence and three-dimensional homology with rhodopsin. The function of the beta AR is diminished by exposure to stimulatory agonists, leading to desensitization. Similarly, 'light adaptation' involves decreased coupling of photoactivated rhodopsin to cGMP phosphodiesterase activation. Both forms of desensitization involve receptor phosphorylation. The latter is mediated by a unique protein kinase, rhodopsin kinase, which phosphorylates only the light-bleached form of rhodopsin. An analogous enzyme (termed beta AR kinase or beta ARK) phosphorylates only the agonist-occupied beta AR. We report here that beta ARK is also capable of phosphorylating rhodopsin in a totally light-dependent fashion. Moreover, rhodopsin kinase can phosphorylate the agonist-occupied beta AR.

To determine, whether LHRH antagonists might be similar in this respect to the agonists, we treated male rats for 4 weeks with daily sc injections of LHRH antagonist [Ac-D-Nal2,Phe(4Cl)2,D-Pal(3)3, D-Cit6,D-Ala10]LHRH (Cetrorelix acetate) or LHRH agonist, [D-Trp6]LHRH, in doses of 100 micrograms/animal-day. Another group of rats received a single im injection of 4.5 mg Cetrorelix pamoate depot, a sustained delivery formulation of the LHRH antagonist. An iv stimulation test with LHRH (200 ng/rat) was performed after 4 weeks of treatment. The rats were killed, and pituitary LHRH receptor characteristics were measured by RRA. To examine the effect of LHRH antagonist treatment on the expression of the pituitary LHRH receptor gene, some of the rats injected with Cetrorelix pamoate depot were killed after 2 weeks, and levels of LHRH receptor mRNA were determined by Northern blot and dot blot hybridization to a 32P-labeled rat complementary DNA probe. Our data show that LHRH-stimulated LH secretion at 30 min was suppressed by approximately 33% (P < 0.01) in rats pretreated with [D-Trp6]LHRH compared to that in animals injected with LHRH alone. Pretreatment of the rats with the LHRH antagonist suppressed the LH response to LHRH more markedly, the LH levels at 30 min were decreased by 89.8% and 96% in groups treated with Cetrorelix acetate and Cetrorelix pamoate depot, respectively. The testosterone response was virtually abolished in groups receiving Cetrorelix. The concentration of pituitary receptors for LHRH fell by 69% in the [D-Trp6]LHRH group, whereas the reductions in the Cetrorelix acetate group and in the group that received Cetrorelix pamoate depot were 77% and 82%, respectively. Treatment with Cetrorelix pamoate depot led to a 75-80% decrease in the levels of 5.0- and 4.5-kilobase forms of LHRH receptor mRNA compared to those in the control group. Dot blot analysis also showed 83% reduction in the mRNA for LHRH receptor. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that prolonged administration of LHRH antagonists such as Cetrorelix causes an impairment of gonadotropin secretion and a marked decrease in the levels of LHRH receptors as well as in the expression of the LHRH receptor gene. Thus, the down-regulation of pituitary LHRH receptors produced by LHRH antagonists appears to be similar to that resulting from the agonists.",1996,17,69,1,0,3,3,7,7,5,7,5,2,3

Peptides with the highest affinity had the structure Cys-A1-A2-X, where positions A1 and A2 are occupied by aliphatic amino acids and position X is occupied by a COOH-terminal methionine, serine, or phenylalanine. Charged residues reduced affinity slightly at the A1 position and much more drastically at the A2 and X positions. Effective inhibitors included tetrapeptides corresponding to the COOH termini of all animal cell proteins known to be farnesylated. In contrast, the tetrapeptide Cys-Ala-Ile-Leu (CAIL), which corresponds to the COOH termini of several neural guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein gamma subunits, did not compete in the farnesyl-transfer assay. Inasmuch as several of these proteins are geranylgeranylated, the data suggest that the two isoprenes (farnesyl and geranylgeranyl) are transferred by different enzymes. A biotinylated heptapeptide corresponding to the COOH terminus of p21Ki-rasB was farnesylated, suggesting that at least some of the peptides serve as substrates for the transferase.

Particularly noteworthy are the large enthalpies and the negative entropies of complexation obtained for the alkali cation complexes (Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ cryptates). The Sr2+ and Ba2+ as well as [Li+ ⊂ 2.1.1]1 and [Na+ ⊂ 2.2.1] cryptates are of the enthalpy dominant type with also a favourable entropy change. The Ca2+ and [Li+ ⊂ 2.2.1] cryptates are entirely entropy stabilized with about zero heat of reaction. The high stability of the macrobicyclic complexes as compared to the macromonocylcic ones, the cryptate effect, is of enthalpic origin. The enthalpies of complexation display selectivity peaks, as do the stabilities, whereas the entropy changes do not. The high M2+/M+ selectivities found in terms of free energy, may be reversed when enthalpy is considered in view of the very different role played by the entropy term for M2+ and M+ cations. The enthalpies and entropies of ligation show that whereas the cryptate anions are similar in terms of entropy irrespective of which cation is included, the ligands, despite being more rigid than the hydration shell, are nevertheless able to adjust to some extent to the cation. This conclusion agrees with published X-rays data. The origin of the enthalpies and entropies of complexation is discussed in terms of structural features of the ligands and of solvation effects.",1976,18,122,1,1,1,4,9,4,3,4,6,4,3

5de73ada0176daee402e26e474123da55bc7851f,Facile charge-displacement at silicon gives spaced-out reaction.,"Adsorbates on metals, but not previously on semiconductors, have been observed to display long-range repulsive interactions. On metals, due to efficient dissipation, the repulsions are weak, typically on the order of 5 meV at 10 Å. On the 7×7 reconstruction of the Si(111) surface, charge transport through the surface has been demonstrated by others using charge injection by STM tips. Here we show that for both physisorbed brominated molecules, and for chemisorbed Br-atoms, induced charge-transfer in the Si(111)-7×7 surface can lead to a strong repulsive interaction between adsorbates, calculated as 200 meV at 13.4 Å. This large repulsive interaction must be channeled through the surface since it causes widely spaced ""one-per-corner-hole"" patterns of physisorption (three cases--directly observed here) and subsequent chemisorption (four cases observed). The patterns were observed by ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy for four different brominated hydrocarbon adsorbates; 1,2-dibromoethane, 1-bromopropane, 1-bromopentane, and bromobenzene, deposited individually on the surface. In every case, adsorbates were overwhelmingly more likely to be found singly than multiply adjacent to a corner-hole, constituting a distinctive pattern having a probability p = 7 × 10(-5) compared to a random distribution.",2011,26,6,0,1,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0

In the present study, we investigated the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP pathway for its ability to regulate the state of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 in slices of rat substantia nigra. DARPP-32 was phosphorylated on threonine-34 in these slices by sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor. The effect of SNP was abolished by preincubation of the slices with hemoglobin, indicating that the effect of SNP was due to released NO. The same concentration of SNP produced a 4-fold elevation of the cGMP level but did not alter the level of cAMP. The effect of SNP on DARPP-32 phosphorylation was mimicked by low concentrations of 8-bromo-cGMP and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, activators of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, but not by low concentrations of 8-bromo-cAMP, an activator of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The data indicate a physiological role for the NO/cGMP pathway in the regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation in nerve terminals of striatonigral neurons. The results provide further evidence that the state of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 represents an important mechanisms for integration of information arriving at striatonigral neurons via a variety of neuronal pathways.",1993,0,113,2,0,6,7,6,5,8,9,9,9,4

We now find that HIV-1 begins reverse transcription much more efficiently in DCs than T cells, even though T cells have higher levels of CD4 and gp120 binding. DCs isolated from skin or from blood precursors behave similarly. Several M-tropic strains and the T-tropic strain IIIB enter DCs efficiently, as assessed by the progressive formation of the early products of reverse transcription after a 90-min virus pulse at 37°C. However, few late gag-containing sequences are detected, so that active viral replication does not occur. The formation of these early transcripts seems to follow entry of HIV-1, rather than binding of virions that contain viral DNA. Early transcripts are scarce if DCs are exposed to virus on ice for 4 h, or for 90 min at 37°C, conditions which allow virus binding. Also the early transcripts once formed are insensitive to trypsin. The entry of a M-tropic isolates is blocked by the chemokine RANTES, and the entry of IIIB by SDF-1. RANTES interacts with CCR5 and SDF-1 with CXCR4 receptors. Entry of M-tropic but not T-tropic virus is ablated in DCs from individuals who lack a functional CCR5 receptor. DCs express more CCR5 and CXCR4 mRNA than T cells. Therefore, while HIV-1 does not replicate efficiently in mature DCs, viral entry can be active and can be blocked by chemokines that act on known receptors for M- and T-tropic virus.",1996,39,260,6,0,20,32,46,28,21,10,10,6,11

A multimodal frame analysis of the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict,"Pictures play an ever-increasing role in the public’s understanding of mediated events. However, many studies show that visuals remain an understudied field, especially when it comes to multimodal approaches. This remains an important issue in today’s media environment, where visuals and their interaction with textual contents are becoming increasingly important carriers of meaning. The following paper presents results from a multimodal quantitative content analysis of the online coverage of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, wherein an innovative comparative approach to visual and textual frames was applied. We examine the existing frames, identify patterns of visual and textual frame co-occurrence and describe changes of the applied multimodal framing. Overall, a sample of 150 texts and 219 pictures was coded. The study shows that the applied visual and textual frames initially correspond with each other thematically. During the course of the conflict, however, the provided textual and visual framing divert increasingly. While the textual mode more or less upholds its original framing of the events, the visual level intensifies the framing strategy it has adopted since the escalation of the conflict began. As a result, textual coverage focuses more on negotiations and solutions, whereas images become increasingly graphic.",2019,106,9,1,1,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For example, time-dependent shifts in spectral features (spectral diffusion) are expected to result from motions of the molecules surrounding the impurity species. Recent advances in high-efficiency fluorescence excitation spectroscopy using ultra-thin sublimed crystals3 have now removed the earlier obstacle of low signal-to-noise ratios. Here we report the observation of jumps in the resonance frequency, on timescales of seconds to minutes, in the fluorescence excitation spectrum of single molecules of pentacene in crystals of p-terphenyl cooled to 1.5 K. These effects are seen only for some impurities, which probably correspond to pentacene molecules in particularly strained local environments; most impurities show no time-dependent behaviour. We speculate on the possible causes of these spectral jumps, although further work will be required to draw definitive conclusions about the molecular motions involved.",1991,17,280,3,6,8,13,11,7,9,12,10,9,8

dc1dca8566f620d3c1a36337783f224d45fcbfa6,CP Violation in the Renormalizable Theory of Weak Interaction,"In a framework of the renormalizable theory of weak interaction, problems of CP-violation are studied. It is concluded that no realistic models of CP-violation exist in the quartet scheme without introducing any other new fields. Some possible models of CP-violation are also discussed. When we apply the renormalizable theory of weak interaction1l to the hadron system, we have some limitations on the hadron model. It is well known that there exists, in the case of the triplet model, a difficulty of the strangeness chang­ ing neutral current and that the quartet model is free from this difficulty. Fur­ thermore, Maki and one of the present authors (T.M.) have shown2l that, in the latter case, the strong interaction must be chiral SU ( 4) X SU ( 4) invariant as precisely as the conservation of the third component of the iso-spin 13 • In addi­ tion to these arguments, for the theory to be realistic, CP-violating interactions should be incorporated in a gauge invariant way. This requirement will impose further limitations on the hadron model and the CP-violating interaction itself. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate this problem. In the following, it will be shown that in the case of the above-mentioned quartet model, we cannot make a CP-violating interaction without introducing any other new fields when we require the following conditions: a) The mass of the fourth member of the quartet, which we will call (, is sufficiently large, b) the model should be con­ sistent with our well-established knowledge of the semi-leptonic processes. After that some possible ways of bringing CP-violation into the theory will be discussed. We consider the quartet model with a charge assignment of Q, Q -1, Q -1 and Q for p, n, A. and (, respectively, and we take the same underlying gauge group SUweak (2) X SU(1) and the scalar doublet field cp as those of Weinberg's original model.1l Then, hadronic parts of the Lagrangian can be devided in the following way:",1973,4,4644,128,0,1,1,7,16,21,70,69,77,61

Both IF1 and STF1 inhibit F1, whereas the proposed function for STF2 is to facilitate the binding of IF1 and STF1 to F1. The oligomerization properties of yeast IF1and STF1 have been investigated by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and by covalent cross-linking. Both techniques confirm that IF1 and STF1 oligomerize in opposite directions in relation to pH, suggesting that both proteins might regulate yeast F1F0-ATPase under different conditions. Their effects on bovine F-ATPases are also described. Whereas bovine IF1 inhibits yeast F1-ATPase even better than yeast IF1 or STF1, the capability of yeast IF1 to inhibit the bovine enzyme is very low and decreases with time. Such an effect is also observed in the study of the homologous inhibition of yeast F1-ATPase.

1fa2107afee94628623603b5422a17b8b36ddb99,Nobel Lecture: The invention and early history of the CCD,"To try to indicate how the invention of charge coupled devices CCDs in 1969 by W. S. Boyle and myself came about, it is first necessary to describe three important technologies being pursued at the time. Magnetic bubbles, the silicon diode array vidicon for the Picturephone, and metal oxide semiconductor MOS technology were all contributing factors to the invention of the device. Magnetic bubbles were formed by placing a special magnetic material, typically garnet, in a magnetic field so that circular magnetic domains could be formed as shown in Fig. 1. A Permalloy pattern was deposited on the surface which could capture the domain, and when a rotating magnetic field was applied in the plane of the slice, the bubble would be shifted along from one site to the next. With an input device to inject the presence or absence of bubbles representing 0’s or 1’s and a detection device at the end, one had a serial memory device. The second driving technology being worked on, which just happened to be in my department, was the silicon diode array camera tube, shown in Fig. 2. This was being developed for the Picturephone, which AT&T—Bell Labs parent and the major telephone provider at the time—thought would be a huge market once people discovered they could see as well as hear one another over the existing twisted pair phone lines. The initial imaging device considered was the standard commercial vidicon with an antimony trisulfide coating on glass accessed by an electron beam as the photosensitive element. This device was notorious for its lack of robustness and longevity. Instead, we were working on a tube with a silicon slice with millions of diodes placed on the surface, which were accessed by an electron beam in a similar manner. The silicon was an improvement; however, we strongly hoped to find an all solid state device to eliminate the electron beam. The third field being vigorously pursued was MOS transistor technology. This was the technology that finally became the basis of all modern integrated circuits. The metal oxide semiconductor capacitor that forms the gate of the MOS transistor is shown in Fig. 3. Basic studies of this structure were also being carried out in my department. To understand the atmosphere at the time, one must look at the structure of the Electronics Division at Bell Labs, which was under Vice President Jack Morton. This was split into two divisions, one for semiconductor devices and one for all others. Bill Boyle was Executive Director of the semiconductor part and I was a Department Head under him. Jack Morton was anxious to speed up the development of magnetic bubbles as a major memory technology, and there was talk of transferring resources from Bill’s division to the other where the bubble work was being done. For this not to happen, Morton demanded that Bill’s division come up with a semiconductor device to compete with bubbles. To address this demand, on October 17, 1969, Bill and I got together in his office. In a discussion lasting not much more than an hour, the basic structure of the CCD was sketched out on the blackboard, the principles of operation defined, and some preliminary ideas concerning applications were developed. The train of thought evolved as follows. First, the semiconductor analogy of the magnetic bubble is needed. The electric dual is a packet of charge. The next problem is how to store this charge in a confined region. The structure which came to mind, of course, was the simple MOS capacitor shown in Fig. 3. Charge can be introduced into this depletion region with the amount of charge stored being the magnitude of the signal. To understand this better, a plot of electron energy vs distance into the structure is shown in Fig. 4. As charge is introduced into the depletion region, the potential at the surface rises until the maximum allowable charge is reached. Any further charge added will flow into the substrate. The last problem was to shift the charge from one site to another, thereby allowing manipulation of the information. This is solved by simply placing the MOS capacitors very close together as shown in Fig. 5, one with",2010,3,34,0,1,3,2,3,3,1,5,4,1,5

Calculations are presently in progress to see if this nonadiabaticity equals that expected from a companion paper on analytical mechanics of certain collisions.

The solution structure of MNK3, its copper(I)-binding properties, and its interaction with the physiological partner, HAH1, have been studied. MNK3 is the domain most dissimilar in structure from the other domains of the Menkes protein. This is reflected in a significant rearrangement of the last strand of the four-stranded β-sheet when compared with the other known homologous proteins or protein domains. MNK3 is also peculiar with respect to its interaction with the copper(I) ion, as it was found to be a comparatively weak binder. Copper(I) transfer from metal-loaded HAH1 was observed experimentally, but the metal distribution was shifted toward binding by HAH1.

Like other voltage-dependent K+ channels, Ca2+-activated K+ channels open when the cell membrane depolarizes, but in contrast to other voltage-dependent K+ channels, they also open when intracellular Ca2+ concentrations rise. Channel opening by Ca2+ is made possible by a structure called the gating ring, which is located in the cytoplasm. Recent structural studies have defined the Ca2+-free, closed, conformation of the gating ring, but the Ca2+-bound, open, conformation is not yet known. Here we present the Ca2+-bound conformation of the gating ring. This structure shows how one layer of the gating ring, in response to the binding of Ca2+, opens like the petals of a flower. The degree to which it opens explains how Ca2+ binding can open the transmembrane pore. These findings present a molecular basis for Ca2+ activation of K+ channels and suggest new possibilities for targeting the gating ring to treat conditions such as asthma and hypertension.",2012,50,132,5,17,15,22,18,11,17,10,11,5,5

Few would challenge the assertion that the emergence of template-directed synthetic protocols has aided and abetted the facile and efficient construction of MIMs compared with the statistical approaches employed while the field was still in its infancy. To date, a panoply of MIMs has been created in the wake of emerging recognition motifs and the template-directed synthetic protocols they have forged. Among these motifs, those dependent on π–π stacking in the form of donor–acceptor interactions have played an important role in the increasingly rapid development of the field. The few integrated systems that have so far emerged based on this class of MIMs demonstrate their ability to act as active components in many potential applications. This review focuses on the progress which has been accomplished during the past decade involving MIMs comprising aromatic π–π stacking interactions.

Current models suggest that SNARE-complex assembly catalyzes membrane fusion by pulling the transmembrane regions (TMRs) of SNARE proteins together, thus allowing their TMRs to form a fusion pore. These models are consistent with the requirement for TMRs in viral fusion proteins. However, the role of the SNARE TMRs in synaptic vesicle fusion has not yet been tested physiologically. Here, we examined whether synaptic SNAREs require TMRs for catalysis of synaptic vesicle fusion, which was monitored electrophysiologically at millisecond time resolution. Surprisingly, we find that both lipid-anchored syntaxin-1 and lipid-anchored synaptobrevin-2 lacking TMRs efficiently promoted spontaneous and Ca(2+)-triggered membrane fusion. Our data suggest that SNARE proteins function during fusion primarily as force generators, consistent with the notion that forcing lipid membranes close together suffices to induce membrane fusion.",2013,57,91,8,4,10,22,8,18,12,5,5,6,0

Measured relations between feed intake and methane yields for animal species are combined with population statistics to deduce a current yearly input of methane to the atmosphere of 74 Tg (1 Tg = 10 12 g). with an uncertainty of about 15%. Of this, cattle contribute about 74%. Buffalos and sheep each account for 8-9%, and the remainder stems from camels, mules and asses, pigs, and horses. Human CH 4 production is probably less than 1 Tg per year. The mean annual increase in CH 4 emission from domestic animals and humans over the past 20 years has been 0.6 Tg, or 0.75% per year. Population figures on wild ruminants are so uncertain that calculated CH, emissions from this source may range between 2 Tg and 6 Tg per year. Current CH 4 emission by domestic and wild animals is estimated to be about 78 Tg, representing 15-25% of the total CH 4 released to the atmosphere from all sources. The likely CH 4 production from domestic animals in 1890 was about 17 Tg, so that this source has increased by a factor of 4.4. A brief tentative discussion is also given on the potential CH 4 production by other herbivorous fauna, especially insects. Their total CH 4 production probably does not exceed 30 Tg annually.

One of the first steps in the degradation of a protein via this pathway involves selective modification of ϵ‐NH2 groups of internal lysine residues by ubiquitination. To date, this amino group has been the only known target for ubiquitination. Here we report that the N‐terminal residue of MyoD is sufficient and necessary for promotion of conjugation and subsequent degradation of the protein. Substitution of all lysine residues in the protein did not affect significantly its conjugation and degradation either in vivoor in vitro. In cells, degradation of the lysine‐less protein is inhibited by the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin. Inhibition is accompanied by accumulation of high molecular mass ubiquitinated forms of the modified MyoD. In striking contrast, wild‐type MyoD, in which all the internal Lys residues have been retained but the N‐terminus has been extended by fusion of a short peptide, is stable both in vivo and in vitro. In a cell‐free system, ATP and multiple ubiquitination are essential for degradation of the lysine‐less protein. Specific chemical modifications have yielded similar results. Selective blocking of the α‐NH2 group of wild‐type protein renders it stable, while modification of the internal Lys residues with preservation of the free N‐terminal group left the protein susceptible to degradation. Our data suggest that conjugation of MyoD occurs via a novel modification involving attachment of ubiquitin to the N‐terminal residue. The polyubiquitin chain is then synthesized on an internal Lys residue of the linearly attached first ubiquitin moiety.",1998,48,289,11,1,7,16,9,12,13,28,21,11,24

The fatty acids provide energy for gluconeogenesis in liver and are taken up by muscle, sparing glucose. After prolonged starvation, fat stores are depleted, yet blood glucose can be maintained at levels sufficient to preserve life. Using a new mouse model, we demonstrate that survival after prolonged starvation requires ghrelin, an octanoylated peptide hormone that stimulates growth hormone (GH) secretion. We studied wild-type mice and mice lacking ghrelin as a result of knockout of GOAT, the enzyme that attaches octanoate to ghrelin. Mice were fed 40% of their normal intake for 7 d. Fat stores in both lines of mice became depleted after 4 d. On day 7, mice were fasted for 23 h. In wild-type mice, ghrelin and GH rose massively, and blood sugar was maintained at ~60 mg/dL. In Goat(-/-) mice, ghrelin was undetectable and GH failed to rise appropriately. Blood sugar declined to ~20 mg/dL, and the animals were moribund. Infusion of ghrelin or GH prevented hypoglycemia. Our results support the following sequence: (1) Starvation lowers blood glucose; (2) glucose-sensing neurons respond by activating sympathetic neurons; (3) norepinephrine, released in the stomach, stimulates ghrelin secretion; (4) ghrelin releases GH, which maintains blood glucose. Thus, ghrelin lies at the center of a hormonal response that permits mice to survive an acute fast superimposed on chronic starvation.",2011,0,85,1,2,3,9,5,8,12,11,5,10,8

The presence of both cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with bacterial meningitis has been documented recently. In this study, we measured concentrations of interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in CSF samples from 36 patients with nonbacterial (aseptic) meningitis, 13 of whom had culture-proved enteroviral meningitis, and from 14 control patients. None of the samples from patients with aseptic meningitis and from the controls had detectable tumor necrosis factor activity in CSF. Thirty-two (89%) of 36 patients with aseptic meningitis had detectable interleukin 1 beta in CSF (mean +/- SEM, 48 +/- 11 pg/mL). These concentrations were significantly smaller than those previously reported in patients with bacterial meningitis (944 +/- 128 pg/mL). Only 2 of the 14 control patients had detectable CSF interleukin 1 beta concentrations of 21 and 42 pg/mL. A significant correlation was evident between interleukin-1 beta concentrations and white blood cell counts in the CSF of patients with aseptic meningitis.

Tissues studied and their proportions of β 1 and /gb 2 receptors were: rat lung (18% β 1 , 82% β 2 ), rabbit lung (72% β 1 , 28% β 2 ), guinea pig lung (15% β 1 , 85% β 2 ), dog lung (20% β 1 , 80% β 2 ) and rabbit skeletal muscle (10% β 1 , 90% β 2 ). As assessed by autoradiograms of sodium dodecyi sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two to three specifically protected bands of M r 62,000–65,000, 50,000–55,000 and 38,000–42,000 were observed in each tissue system. In each case, β-adrenergic agonists and antagonists protected against photolabeling with appropriate β 1 and β 2 selectivity. Thus, in rat lung the β 2 selective antagonist ICI-118,551 was more potent in blocking incorporation than the β 1 selective antagonist betaxolol, whereas in rat, dog and guinea pig lung and rabbit skeletal muscle epinephrine was more potent than norepinephrine in blocking labeling, indicating a β 2 specificity in these tissues. Conversely, in rabbit lung membranes, norepinephrine was approximately equipotent with epinephrine in blocking photoincorporation, indicating a β 1 selectivity. In some systems protease inhibitors, especially those specific for metalloproteases (EDTA, EGTA), markedly diminished the amount of the smaller M r peptides. For example, in rat lung the ratio of M r 62,000 :47,000:36,000 peptides changed from 30:40:30 to 60:35:5 in the presence of inhibitors. These results demonstrate the applicability of using [ 125 I]para-azidobenzylcarazolol to covalently label mammalian β-adrenergic receptors and suggest that mammalian β 1 and β 2 receptor binding sites primarily reside on peptides of M r 62,000–65,000 and that smaller ligand binding fragments may arise by proteolysis.",1984,13,14,0,0,1,3,4,2,1,0,1,0,0

The cAMP-dependent protein kinase, a heterodimer of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits, has been shown to become stably activated only during long-term facilitation. Both acquisition of long-term facilitation and persistent activation of the kinase is blocked by anisomycin, an effective, reversible, and specific inhibitor of protein synthesis in Aplysia. We report here that 2-hr exposure of pleural sensory cells to serotonin lowers the concentration of regulatory subunits but does not change the concentration of catalytic subunits, as assayed 24 hr later; 5-min exposure to serotonin has no effect on either type of subunit. Increasing intracellular cAMP with a permeable analog of cAMP together with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl methylxanthine also decreased regulatory subunits, suggesting that cAMP is the second messenger mediating serotonin action. Anisomycin blocked the loss of regulatory subunits only when applied with serotonin; application after the 2-hr treatment with serotonin had no effect. In the Aplysia accessory radula contractor muscle, prolonged exposure to serotonin or to the peptide transmitter small cardioactive peptide B, both of which produce large increases in intracellular cAMP, does not decrease regulatory subunits. This mechanism of regulating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase therefore may be specific to the nervous system.

The pulses (energy up to 500 pJ and duration 60 fs) were launched into a 4 cm length of PCF (core diameter 1.7 microm and zero-dispersion wavelength approximately 1060 nm). Less than 20 pJ of launched pulse energy was sufficient to generate a supercontinuum from 600 nm to 1450 nm, which represents the lowest energy so far reported for generation of an octave-spanning supercontinuum from a 1 microm pump. Since the laser pulse energy scales inversely with the repetition rate, highly compact and efficient sources based on SF6-glass PCF are likely to be especially useful for efficient spectral broadening at high repetition rates (several GHz), such as those needed for the precise calibration of astronomical spectrographs, where a frequency comb spacing >10 GHz is required for the best performance.",2009,16,44,1,3,11,4,5,4,1,3,4,2,2

We engineered a variant of ChR, denoted red-activatable ChR (ReaChR), that is optimally excited with orange to red light (λ ∼590–630 nm) and offers improved membrane trafficking, higher photocurrents and faster kinetics compared to existing red-shifted ChRs. Red light is less scattered by tissue and is absorbed less by blood than the blue to green wavelengths that are required by other ChR variants. We used ReaChR expressed in the vibrissa motor cortex to drive spiking and vibrissa motion in awake mice when excited with red light through intact skull. Precise vibrissa movements were evoked by expressing ReaChR in the facial motor nucleus in the brainstem and illumination with red light through the external auditory canal. Thus, ReaChR enables transcranial optical activation of neurons in deep brain structures without the need to surgically thin the skull, form a transcranial window or implant optical fibers.",2013,47,594,43,5,51,102,71,92,75,81,65,50,0

Such an impressive and constant regularity prompted suggestions that grid cells represent a universal and environmental-invariant metric for navigation. Originally the properties of grid patterns were believed to be independent of the shape of the environment and this notion has dominated almost all theoretical grid cell models. However, several studies indicate that environmental boundaries influence grid firing, though the strength, nature and longevity of this effect is unclear. Here we show that grid orientation, scale, symmetry and homogeneity are strongly and permanently affected by environmental geometry. We found that grid patterns orient to the walls of polarized enclosures such as squares, but not circles. Furthermore, the hexagonal grid symmetry is permanently broken in highly polarized environments such as trapezoids, the pattern being more elliptical and less homogeneous. Our results provide compelling evidence for the idea that environmental boundaries compete with the internal organization of the grid cell system to drive grid firing. Notably, grid cell activity is more local than previously thought and as a consequence cannot provide a universal spatial metric in all environments.",2015,23,242,19,24,25,45,49,41,35,21,0,0,0

37e2ed64a84af50454f851ed8143ddf653aece74,Rediscovering sperm ion channels with the patch-clamp technique.,"Upon ejaculation, mammalian spermatozoa have to undergo a sequence of physiological transformations within the female reproductive tract that will allow them to reach and fertilize the egg. These include initiation of motility, hyperactivation of motility and perhaps chemotaxis toward the egg, and culminate in the acrosome reaction that permits sperm to penetrate the protective vestments of the egg. These physiological responses are triggered through the activation of sperm ion channels that cause elevations of sperm intracellular pH and Ca(2+) in response to certain cues within the female reproductive tract. Despite their key role in sperm physiology and their absolute requirement for the process of fertilization, sperm ion channels remain poorly understood due to the extreme difficulty in application of the patch-clamp technique to spermatozoa. This review covers the topic of sperm ion channels in the following order: first, we discuss how the intracellular Ca(2+) and pH signaling mediated by sperm ion channels controls sperm behavior during the process of fertilization. Then, we briefly cover the history of the methodology to study sperm ion channels, which culminated in the recent development of a reproducible whole-cell patch-clamp technique for mouse and human cells. We further discuss the main approaches used to patch-clamp mature mouse and human spermatozoa. Finally, we focus on the newly discovered sperm ion channels CatSper, KSper (Slo3) and HSper (H(v)1), identified by the sperm patch-clamp technique. We conclude that the patch-clamp technique has markedly improved and shifted our understanding of the sperm ion channels, in addition to revealing significant species-specific differences in these channels. This method is critical for identification of the molecular mechanisms that control sperm behavior within the female reproductive tract and make fertilization possible.",2011,186,84,4,1,12,11,12,11,6,8,7,5,9

Several SBVS strategies, employing different H4R ligand conformations, were validated and optimized with respect to their ability to discriminate small fragment-like H4R ligands from true inactive fragments, and compared to ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) approaches. SBVS studies with a molecular interaction fingerprint (IFP) scoring method enabled the identification of H4R ligands that were not identified in LBVS runs, demonstrating the scaffold hopping potential of combining molecular docking and IFP scoring. Retrospective VS evaluations against H4R homology models based on the histamine H1 receptor (H1R) crystal structure did not give higher enrichments of H4R ligands than H4R models based on the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β2R). Complementary prospective SBVS studies against β2R-based and H1R-based H4R homology models led to the discovery of different new fragment-like H4R ligand chemotypes.

Injecting eggs with in vitro synthesized torso mRNAs revealed that torso activation is governed by an extracellular molecule, presumably the torso ligand, produced at terminal regions of the egg during early embryogenesis. In the absence of torso, the ligand shows no apparent localization, indicating that it is diffusible and normally bound by an excess of torso receptor at the egg poles. Mutant ligand-binding torso proteins can suppress telson formation in a dominant negative manner, suggesting that the ligand is limited in amount.

Genetically encoded indicators of neuronal activity allow long-term, cell type–specific expression. Fluorescent Ca2+ indicator proteins (FCIPs), a main class of reporters of neural activity, initially suffered, in particular, from an inability to report single action potentials in vivo. Although suboptimal Ca2+-binding dynamics and Ca2+-induced fluorescence changes in FCIPs are important factors, low levels of expression also seem to play a role. Here we report that delivering D3cpv, an improved fluorescent resonance energy transfer–based FCIP, using a recombinant adeno-associated virus results in expression sufficient to detect the Ca2+ transients that accompany single action potentials.

5356f167148f01b4d0a92b037ed6cee3a02952ba,Specific binding of a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide to yeast cytochrome c mRNA,"THE investigation of specific messenger RNAs in terms of sequence analysis and of the control of their synthesis, processing, translation and degradation is one of the major interests of modern molecular biology. These studies have been possible so far in only the few cases where a cell type is known to synthesise predominantly one species of protein. Since most mRNAs are chemically similar, differing only in size and sequence, it has been difficult to purify them by conventional methods. Given the amino acid sequence of a protein, one can use the genetic code to deduce a sequence of nucleotides in a specific region of the mRNA and then synthesise an oligodeoxyribonucleotide complementary to that region1–4. We have chosen to investigate the yeast iso-1 cytochrome c mRNA as a model system for the use of synthetic oligonucleotides as specific probes of eucaryotic mRNA structure and function. The genetics of yeast iso-1 cytochrome c has been studied in great detail by Sherman, Stewart and co-workers5,6, who have determined the sequence of 44 nucleotides of the mRNA from the analysis of altered cytochromes produced by a series of double frameshift mutants. In addition, a number of well defined deletion mutants are available within this region. The pentadecadeoxyribonucleotide (15-mer) that we decided to synthesise, 5′–d(A–G–C–A–C–C–T–T–T–C–T–T–A–G–C)3′ is complementary to nucleotides 25–39 of the cytochrome c mRNA (Fig. 1). This sequence was chosen because it is relatively easy to synthesise, should form a very stable hybrid with mRNA, and is close to the 5′ end of the coding region of the mRNA. A known deletion mutation covers this region, yet allows the production of a functional cytochrome c in normal amounts5,6, and thus provides an excellent control for hybridisation experiments. We have been able to show that the synthetic 15-mer does indeed bind specifically to the expected region of the mRNA, and therefore should be useful as a specific probe for the study of this mRNA.",1977,21,34,0,1,5,4,6,3,0,1,2,0,0

At first I wondered why I, a biologist and a person with less than enviable college grades in Chemistry, had been selected. Then I realized that this prize had actually been given to the GFP molecule, and I am one of its assistants. Thank you for letting me be part of the celebration of a wonderful tool for visualizing life. Scientific inquiry starts with observation. The more one can see, the more one can investigate. Indeed, we often mark our progress in science by improvements in imaging. The first Nobel Prize, the Physics Prize of 1901, was an “imaging prize”, given to Wilhelm R ntgen for his discovery of X-rays and their astonishing ability to allow the non-invasive viewing of the human skeleton. A few years later the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded for the development of silver nitrate staining to visualize nerve cells by Camillo Golgi and its improvement and use by Santiago Ram n y Cajal to demonstrate the cellular nature of the nervous system. This research laid the groundwork of modern neurobiology. Over the years, several other imaging techniques and their developers have been honored by the Nobel Foundation, including X-ray crystallography (William and Lawrence Bragg, Physics, 1915), the ultramicroscope (Richard Zsigmondy, Chemistry, 1925), nuclear magnetic resonance (Felix Bloch and E. M. Purcell, Physics, 1952), the phase-contrast microscope (Frits Zernike, Physics, 1953), large-array radio telescopes (Martin Ryle, Physics, 1974), the electron microscope (Ernst Ruska, Physics, 1986), the scanning tunneling microscope (Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, Physics, 1986), computer-assisted tomography (Allan M. Cormack and Godfrey N. Hounsfield, Physiology or Medicine, 1979), and, most recently, magnetic resonance imaging (Paul C. Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield, Physiology or Medicine, 2003). My road to imaging was not direct. I had been interested in science from when I was very young, but after a disastrous summer lab experience in which every experiment I tried failed, I decided on graduating from college that I was not cut out to be a scientist.

We have isolated a rat brain 5HT2 serotonin receptor cDNA by virtue of its homology with the 5HT1c receptor. The 5HT2 receptor is a member of the family of receptors that are linked to guanine nucleotide-binding proteins and are predicted to span the lipid bilayer seven times. Overall sequence identity between the 5HT2 and 5HT1c receptors is 49%, but identity within the transmembrane domains is 80%. Expression of both the 5HT2 and 5HT1c receptors in transfected mouse fibroblasts activates phospholipase C signaling pathways and promotes cellular transformation. However, RNA blotting shows that these two receptor subtypes are differentially expressed in the central nervous system. In this manner, structurally and functionally homologous receptor subtypes may elicit distinct physiologic actions.",1990,2,264,4,5,19,17,22,23,22,13,15,7,10

However, despite a strong CTL response directed against viral epitopes, untreated people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) develop AIDS. To resolve this enigma, we have examined the ability of CTLs to recognize and kill infected primary T lymphocytes. We found that CTLs inefficiently lysed primary cells infected with HIV-1 if the viral nef gene product was expressed. Resistance of infected cells to CTL killing correlated with nef-mediated downregulation of MHC class I (ref. 1) and could be overcome by adding an excess of the relevant HIV-1 epitope as soluble peptide. Thus, Nef protected infected cells by reducing the epitope density on their surface. This effect of nef may allow evasion of CTL lysis by HIV-1-infected cells.",1998,27,1047,47,28,67,65,82,71,45,51,53,46,44

Single copies of the pH-sensitive seminaphthorhodafluor SNARF-1-dextran were immobilized in the pores of agarose gels at different pH in the range 6-9. This probe shows separate emission wavelengths for its protonated and deprotonated forms, such that the ratio between these two emission intensities is a signature of the pH of the surrounding medium. Two-color detection of the time trajectories of single chromophore emission signals allowed characterization of the behavior, molecule by molecule. In particular the distribution of the ratio between the two emission wavelengths, measured over a large number of individual molecules, shows a broadening at pH close to pKa, which cannot be explained by the experimental noise.

Six lines of evidence including sensitivity to proteases demonstrate that this agent contains a protein that is required for infectivity. Although the scrapie agent is irreversibly inactivated by alkali, five procedures with more specificity for modifying nucleic acids failed to cause inactivation. The agent shows heterogeneity with respect to size, apparently a result of its hydrophobicity; the smallest form may have a molecular weight of 50,000 or less. Because the novel properties of the scrapie agent distinguish it from viruses, plasmids, and viroids, a new term ""prion"" is proposed to denote a small proteinaceous infectious particle which is resistant to inactivation by most procedures that modify nucleic acids.

The SNARE motif binds to synaptobrevin and SNAP‐25 to assemble the core complex, whereas almost the entire cytoplasmic sequence participates in a complex with munc18‐1, a neuronal Sec1 homolog. We now demonstrate by NMR spectroscopy that, in isolation, syntaxin adopts a ‘closed’ conformation. This default conformation of syntaxin is incompatible with core complex assembly which requires an ‘open’ syntaxin conformation. Using site‐directed mutagenesis, we find that disruption of the closed conformation abolishes the ability of syntaxin to bind to munc18‐1 and to inhibit secretion in PC12 cells. These results indicate that syntaxin binds to munc18‐1 in a closed conformation and suggest that this conformation represents an essential intermediate in exocytosis. Our data suggest a model whereby, during exocytosis, syntaxin undergoes a large conformational switch that mediates the transition between the syntaxin–munc18‐1 complex and the core complex.",1999,62,711,50,0,34,43,34,36,35,43,35,47,44

Beneficial effects of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) agonists in regeneration of the heart have been demonstrated. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the potential of modern GHRH agonistic analogs in prevention of radiation damage in an in vitro cardiac myocyte-based model. Cultures of cardiac myocytes isolated from newborn rats (NRVM) were exposed to a radiation dose of 10Gy. The effects of the agonistic analogs, JI-34 and MR-356, of human GHRH on cell viability, proliferation, their mechanism of action and the protein expression of the GHRH/SV1 receptors were studied. JI-34 and MR-356, had no effect on cell viability or proliferation in unirradiated cultures. However, in irradiated cells JI-34 showed protective effects on cell viability at concentrations of 10 and 100nM, and MR-356 at 500nM; but no such protective effect was detected on cell proliferation. Both agonistic analogs decreased radiation-induced ROS level and JI-34 interfered with the activation of SAFE/RISK pathways. Using Western blot analysis, a 52kDa protein isoform of GHRHR was detected in the samples in both irradiated and unirradiated cells. Since GHRH agonistic analogs, JI-34 and MR-356 alleviated radiation-induced damage of cardiac myocytes, they should be tested in vivo as potential protective agents against radiogenic heart damage.",2016,50,5,0,0,1,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

A single ribbon‐specific protein is known, RIBEYE, suggesting that ribbons may be constructed from RIBEYE protein. RIBEYE knockdown in zebrafish, however, only reduced but did not eliminate ribbons, indicating a more ancillary role. Here, we show in mice that full deletion of RIBEYE abolishes all presynaptic ribbons in retina synapses. Using paired recordings in acute retina slices, we demonstrate that deletion of RIBEYE severely impaired fast and sustained neurotransmitter release at bipolar neuron/AII amacrine cell synapses and rendered spontaneous miniature release sensitive to the slow Ca2+‐buffer EGTA, suggesting that synaptic ribbons mediate nano‐domain coupling of Ca2+ channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

With a non-spherical equilibrium shape, the equations give rotating solutions in which the self-consistent rotating potentials are determined by the motion of the particles. With no axial symmetry, and neglecting higher order effects in the angular velocities, there are time-dependent solutions corresponding to the general motion of a classical top. For an equilibrium shape with axial symmetry, the only rotational motions are uniform rotations about an axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis. The equations are studied in the density matrix formulation in which the results can be immediately extended to include the effect of pairing correlations. Solutions representing a uniform translational motion can be explicitly constructed. For the rotational motion, the changes in the density matrix are determined for small angular velocities by a linear equation. This contains a correction to the cranking model equation which expresses the effect of a transformation to a moving frame of reference on the velocity-dependent self-consistent potentials. The connection between vibrational and rotational solutions of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock equations is discussed. The rotational models are related to zero-frequency solutions of the equations for small oscillations, and in the linear space of small variations the infinitesimal rotational and translational changes define an independent subspace. This leads to a separation of the rotational and translational energies in the Hamiltonian of the random phase approximation.",1962,18,289,0,1,1,2,4,1,5,4,4,2,1

ae324e1592d0f11f958e57466ad292f4002e0dee,COMPUTER-ASSISTED SYNTHETIC ANALYSIS. THE IDENTIFICATION AND PROTECTION OF INTERFERING FUNCTIONALITY IN MACHINE-GENERATED SYNTHETIC INTERMEDIATES,"The Harvard program for computer-assisted synthetic analysis (LHASA) has been given the ability to identify those functional groups in a structure which will interfere with the effective operation of a synthetic reaction and also to discern whether or not those groups can be protected. The program module (FGR) which is responsible for this function contains data on the level of reactivity of each functional group toward a large number and diversity of chemical reagents. Functional groups are subclassified, when appropriate, according to the environmental features within a molecule which can affect group reactivity. Further, functional groups are characterized either as protectable (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl) or unprotectable (e.g., nitro). During the operation of the FGR program module, the transform evaluation process is conducted so that an examination is made of both the target (product) molecule and the precursor (reactant) molecule. Current capabilities, limitations, and further extensions of this program module are outlined. The deactivation or masking of functional groups is a very important part of synthetic methodology and practice. It may involve the use of an externally derived “protecting” group or take advantage of a connection to another unit within the molecule. The use of these “control operations”’ and others (e.g., activation of functional groups or the introduction of directing groups) often contributes crucially to the experimental realization of a synthetic plan. Generally, the larger the number of functional groups in the molecule to be synthesized, the more likely will be the need for and the greater the importance of functional group protection. This area of organic synthesis is characterized less by the availability of a small number of “ideal” protecting groups than by the alternative of a large arsenal of protecting groups each with a definitely restricted range of applicability. A protecting group must convert some functional group to a form which will not cause interference with reactions aimed at modifying other units in the molecule. Further, there is a reciprocal requirement that the various units in the molecule not interfere with the attachment or removal of a protecting group. The extension of computer-assisted synthetic analysis to sophisticated levels necessitates the detection of functional group interference in synthetic reactions and the use of this information in a manner which is useful to the chemist. This paper2 deals with the handling of functional group interference and protection in the current version of the Harvard program for computer-assisted synthetic analysis (LHASA). The sections which follow outline the chemical data contained in the program, including those relevant to chemical reagents, reaction conditions and functional group reactivity, and the way in which these data are used by the program. I. The Functional Group/Reagent Cross-Reference Table A. Group Reactivities. As indicated p rev iou~ ly ,~ -~ “trees” of synthetic intermediates are generated in LHASA from a target molecule by antithetic (retrosynthetic) analysis. The conversion of a structure in the “synthetic tree” to another structure corresponding to a synthetic precursor is accomplished by the application of a “transform” (retroreaction). Associated with each transform in LHASA are sets of reaction conditions which permit the realization of the synthetic step corresponding to that transform. The assessment of the consequences of applying a specific set of reaction conditions to a given precursor molecule is carried out in LHASA by a Functional Group Reactivity (FGR) module. This module evaluates the chemical reactivity of each functional group present toward the individual reagents which constitute the set of reaction conditions being considered. In order for a general evaluation of the chemical reactivity of any functional group toward any particular reagent to be made by this program module, information must be available concerning the reactivity of every recognized functional group toward a great number and diversity of chemical reagents. The required information has been gathered and assembled into a large functional group/ reagent (FG/RGNT) cross-reference table. This table, a portion of which is shown in expanded form in Figure 1 and which is contained in its entirety in condensed form in Tables I and 11, constitutes the chemical data base of the FGR module. It includes the reactivity levels of all recognizable groups toward 60 different reagents. These reagents, which are collectively referred to as the reagent library, taken individually or in combinations, suffice to describe all reaction conditions presently used by existing LHASA transforms (vide infra). New reagents and hence new reaction conditions can be added easily whenever the need arises. Because the reactivity of many functional groups can depend dramatically on their molecular environment, it was necessary to divide the FG/RGNT table into two sub-tables. One sub-table, REACTB (REACtive functional group TaBle), consists of functional group types whose reactivities are to a reasonable approximation independent of their molecular environment and are determined more by the reactive nature of the groups themselves. Functional groups such as isocyanates, oximes, disulfides, etc., are represented in this sub-table (Table I). The other sub-table, ENVRTB (ENViRonment influenced functional group TaBle), consists of functional groups whose reactivity depends markedly on their molecular environment (see Table 11). Halides, alcohols, electronwithdrawing groups, olefins, and many of the more common organic functional groups fall into this category. Groups of this type are subclassified in ENVRTB according to the structural and chemical features within their molecular environments which are apt to influence reactivity toward a particular chemical reagent. The utilization of a suitable number of subclasses for a functional group permits a reaJournal of the American Chemical Society / 98:l / January 7, I976 21 1 P e p o x i d e ' H i g h Low * L o w Low H i g h * H i g h Low *Moderate* Lor H i g h . . . * I Nitrite H i g h Lor L o r H i g h H i g h H i g h H i g h H i g h H i g h H i g h D i h a l i d e H i g h Low L o r @Moderate* H i g h * H i g h *Moderate.

However, the screening methods have mostly considered only factors that maintain pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, ignoring a potentially long list of other contributing factors involved. To expand the search, we developed a new screening method that examined 2,008 human genes in the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), including not only pluripotent genes but also differentiation‐related genes that suppress pluripotency. We found the top 100 genes that increased reprogramming efficiency and discovered they contained many differentiation‐related genes and homeobox genes. We selected two, HHEX and HLX, for further analysis. These genes enhanced the appearance of premature reprograming cells in the early phase of human iPSC induction, but had inhibitory effect on the late phase. In addition, when expressed in human iPSCs, HHEX and HLX interfered with the pluripotent state, indicating inverse effects on somatic reprograming and pluripotent maintenance. These results demonstrate that our screening is useful for identifying differentiation‐related genes in somatic reprograming. Stem Cells 2016;34:2661–2669",2016,48,5,0,0,2,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

8f45ce013ca122680b226715dd6386671fffee81,The Metastatic Potential and Chemoresistance of Human Pancreatic Cancer Stem Cells,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) typically have the capacity to evade chemotherapy and may be the principal source of metastases. CSCs for human pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) have been identified, but neither the metastatic potential nor the chemoresistance of these cells has been adequately evaluated. We have addressed these issues by examining side-population (SP) cells isolated from the Panc-1 and BxPC3 lines of human PDAC cells, the oncogenotypes of which differ. SP cells could be isolated from monolayers of Panc-1, but only from spheroids of BxPC3. Using orthotopic xenografts into the severely immunocompromised NSG mouse, we found that SP cells isolated from both cell lines produced tumors that were highly metastatic, in contrast to previous experience with PDAC cell lines. SP cells derived from both cell lines expressed the ABCG2 transporter, which was demonstrably responsible for the SP phenotype. SP cells gave rise to non-SP (NSP) cells in vitro and in vivo, a transition that was apparently due to posttranslational inhibition of the ABCG2 transporter. Twenty-two other lines of PDAC cells also expressed ABCG2. The sensitivity of PDAC SP cells to the vinca alkaloid vincristine could be greatly increased by verapamil, a general inhibitor of transporters. In contrast, verapamil had no effect on the killing of PDAC cells by gemcitabine, the current first-line therapeutic for PDAC. We conclude that the isolation of SP cells can be a convenient and effective tool for the study of PDAC CSCs; that CSCs may be the principal progenitors of metastasis by human PDAC; that the ABCG2 transporter is responsible for the SP phenotype in human PDAC cells, and may be a ubiquitous source of drug-resistance in PDAC, but does not confer resistance to gemcitabine; and that inhibition of ABCG2 might offer a useful adjunct in a therapeutic attack on the CSCs of PDAC.",2016,50,34,3,3,6,8,7,4,5,0,0,0,0

5a1dda7def22a6d78181244e50aaa3479f90c4af,cAMP contributes to mossy fiber LTP by initiating both a covalently mediated early phase and macromolecular synthesis-dependent late phase,"Memory storage has a short-term phase that depends on preexisting proteins and a long-term phase that requires new protein and RNA synthesis. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is thought to contribute to memory storage. Consistent with this idea, a cellular representation of these phases has been demonstrated in NMDA receptor-dependent LTP. By contrast, little is known about the NMDA receptor-independent LTP of the mossy fiber pathway. We find that mossy fiber LTP also has phases. Only late phase is blocked by protein and RNA synthesis inhibitors, but both phases are blocked by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and both are stimulated by forskolin and Sp-cAMPS. During early phase, paired-pulse facilitation is occluded. This occlusion decays with the onset of late phase, consistent with its using a different mechanism. Thus, although Schaffer collateral and mossy fiber pathways use very different mechanisms for early phase, both use a cAMP-mediated mechanism for late phase.",1994,48,500,26,3,19,36,27,34,29,29,35,18,24

This picture supports and extends a proposed mechanism for C5-cytosine methylation that may be general for the whole family of C5-cytosine methyltransferases. The structures of the two new complexes have been refined to crystallographic R-factors of 0.189 and 0.178, respectively, at 2.7 A resolution. We observe that both unmethylated 2'-deoxycytidine and 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine flip out of the DNA helix and fit into the active site of the enzyme. The catalytic sulfur atom of Cys81 interacts strongly with C6. The C5 methyl group of the flipped 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine is bent approximately 50 degrees out of the plane of the cytosine ring and towards the sulfur atom of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. This unusual position is probably due to partial sp3 character at C5 and C6 and to steric effects of the conserved amino acid residues Pro80 and Cys81. Two water molecules are held near the hydrophobic edge (C5 and C6) of the flipped cytosine by two conserved amino acid residues (Gln82 and Asn304) and the phosphoryl oxygen atom of the phosphate group 3' to the flipped nucleotide, and one of them may serve as the general base for eliminating the proton from C5. Protonation of the cytosine N3 during the methylation reaction may involve Glu119, which itself might be protonated via a water-mediated interaction between the terminal carboxyl group of Glu119 and the amino group of the methionine moiety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The cofactor thus plays two key roles in the reaction.",1996,0,132,1,1,5,9,7,4,3,15,10,4,11
306753cc1bde16dd7c2b5275670b4b94265e7224,Chromatin and transcription: where do we go from here.,"Not long ago, the very relevance of chromatin structure to transcription was in doubt. The structure of promoters and regulatory sequences could be manipulated and the consequences for transcription determined in vivo without regard to the packaging of the DNA in nucleosomes. Naked DNA could be employed in studies of transcription in vitro, reconstituting most aspects of transcription and its control, without the inclusion of histones or other chromatin proteins. It has since emerged that the role of chromatin is pervasive but could, nonetheless, be neglected in many studies on transcription for at least two reasons. First, numerous chromatin-remodeling complexes make DNA available in vivo, permitting DNA–protein interactions important for transcription despite packaging in nucleosomes and possibly without the complete disruption of chromatin structure. Second, there appear to be at least two levels of transcriptional regulation: one involving chromatin ‘unfolding’ and another involving the transcription machinery at RNA polymerase II promoters. The first level may be a prerequisite for the second, which can then proceed independently; that is, chromatin unfolding may expose promoters for assembly of the transcription machinery, explaining why transcription could be studied so successfully in the past with the use of naked DNA. Chromatin structure and modification Most research and thinking about the transcription of chromatin is based on the nucleosome, the conserved unit of chromatin organization. In reprising what is known, as a point of departure for discussing the outstanding issues in the field, it therefore seems most appropriate to begin with the nucleosome. X-ray structure determination of the histone octamer and nucleosome core particle has revealed a division between globular ‘histone fold’ and extended ‘histone tail’ regions [9,10]. The histone folds are responsible both for the interactions of the histones with one another to form the octamer and for the interactions with DNA that constrain it in a superhelical path around the octamer. The histone tails protrude, making no apparent contribution to either octamer or core particle structure. Inasmuch as the tails contain almost all sites of histone modification — including sites of acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination — it seems reasonable to conclude that these modifications do not affect the structure or stability of the core nucleosome directly. Effects on tail conformation, as well as indirect effects on core nucleosome structure, through the agency of specific tail-binding proteins, are possible but have not yet been demonstrated. Histone modifications, featured in the reviews of this issue, are thought to impart functional diversity to an otherwise monotonous array of nucleosomes. Much of the work performed to date is descriptive, detailing the variety of modifications, the proteins and multiprotein complexes responsible, and the functional consequences. The results are impressive and exciting, showing direct connections with gene regulation, through histone-modifying enzymes that serve as transcriptional regulatory factors, and giving significant insight into the basis for epigenetic effects on gene expression. For the most part, however, the molecular mechanisms involved, and thus a full solution of the problem, remain elusive. Two types of mechanism have been considered: histone modifications as determinants of ‘higher order’ chromatin structure, and histone modifications as tags for recruiting further proteins to specific chromosomal regions. These mechanisms may be related, as in the case of histone acetylation and chromosome condensation.",2002,23,35,1,1,8,2,4,3,5,1,2,0,1

79aa1f304e437929bfb94de5c64ef1a4b2079b48,PCNA function in the activation and strand direction of MutLα endonuclease in mismatch repair,"MutLα (MLH1–PMS2) is a latent endonuclease that is activated in a mismatch-, MutSα-, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-, replication factor C (RFC)-, and ATP-dependent manner, with nuclease action directed to the heteroduplex strand that contains a preexisting break. RFC depletion experiments and use of linear DNAs indicate that RFC function in endonuclease activation is limited to PCNA loading. Whereas nicked circular heteroduplex DNA is a good substrate for PCNA loading and for endonuclease activation on the incised strand, covalently closed, relaxed circular DNA is a poor substrate for both reactions. However, covalently closed supercoiled or bubble-containing relaxed heteroduplexes, which do support PCNA loading, also support MutLα activation, but in this case cleavage strand bias is largely abolished. Based on these findings we suggest that PCNA has two roles in MutLα function: The clamp is required for endonuclease activation, an effect that apparently involves interaction of the two proteins, and by virtue of its loading orientation, PCNA determines the strand direction of MutLα incision.

We have isolated and characterized a full-length cDNA clone for chicken N-cadherin and used this clone to transfect S180 mouse sarcoma cells that do not normally express N-cadherin. The transfected cells (S180cadN cells) expressed N-cadherin on their surfaces and resembled S180 cells transfected with L-CAM (S180L cells) in that at confluence they formed an epithelioid sheet and displayed a large increase in the number of adherens and gap junctions. In addition, N- cadherin in S180cadN cells, like L-CAM in S180L cells, accumulated at cellular boundaries where it was colocalized with cortical actin. In S180L cells and S180cadN cells, L-CAM and N-cadherin were seen at sites of adherens junctions but were not restricted to these areas. Adhesion mediated by either CAM was inhibited by treatment with cytochalasin D that disrupted the actin network of the transfected cells. Despite their known structural similarities, there was no evidence of interaction between L-CAM and N-cadherin. Doubly transfected cells (S180L/cadN) also formed epithelioid sheets. In these cells, both N- cadherin and L-CAM colocalized at areas of cell contact and the presence of antibodies to both CAMs was required to disrupt the sheets of cells. Studies using divalent antibodies to localize each CAM at the cell surface or to perturb their distributions indicated that in the same cell there were no interactions between L-CAM and N-cadherin molecules. These data suggest that the Ca(++)-dependent CAMs are likely to play a critical role in the maintenance of epithelial structures and support a model for the segregation of CAM mediated binding. They also provide further support for the so-called precedence hypothesis that proposes that expression and homophilic binding of CAMs are necessary for formation of junctional structures in epithelia.",1990,42,142,2,3,13,12,15,16,10,10,6,4,6

Here we have characterized a new pathway to the nucleus, mediated by Mtr10p, a protein first identified in a screen for strains defective in polyadenylated RNA export. Mtr10p is shown to be responsible for the nuclear import of the shuttling mRNA-binding protein Npl3p. A complex of Mtr10p and Npl3p was detected in cytosol, and deletion of Mtr10p was shown to lead to the mislocalization of nuclear Npl3p to the cytoplasm, correlating with a block in import. Mtr10p bound peptide repeat-containing nucleoporins and Ran, suggesting that this import pathway involves a docking step at the nuclear pore complex and is Ran dependent. This pathway of Npl3p import is distinct and does not appear to overlap with another known import pathway for an mRNA-binding protein. Thus, at least two parallel pathways function in the import of mRNA-binding proteins, suggesting the need for the coordination of these pathways.",1997,74,106,10,0,26,17,8,12,8,4,6,2,5

7de8fa488de07e2b4837b5ebf2f141d83011436e,Functionally rigid bistable [2]rotaxanes.,"Two-station [2]rotaxanes in the shape of a degenerate naphthalene (NP) shuttle and a nondegenerate monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (MPTTF)/NP redox-controllable switch have been synthesized and characterized in solution. Their dumbbell-shaped components are composed of polyether chains interrupted along their lengths by (i) two pi-electron-rich stations-two NP moieties or a MPTTF unit and a NP moiety-with (ii) a rigid arylethynyl or butadiynyl spacer situated between the two stations and terminated by (iii) flexibly tethered hydrophobic stoppers at each end of the dumbbells. This modification was investigated as a means to simplify both molecular structure and switching function previously observed in related bistable [2]rotaxanes with flexible spacers between their stations and incorporating a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT4+) ring. The nondegenerate MPTTF-NP switch was isolated as near isomer-free bistable [2]rotaxane. Utilization of MPTTF removes the cis/trans isomerization that characterizes the tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) parent core structure. Furthermore, only one translational isomer is observed (> 95 < 5), surprisingly across a wide temperature range (198-323 K), meaning that the CBPQT4+ ring component resides, to all intents and purposes, predominantly on the MPTTF unit in the ground state. As a consequence of these two effects, the assignment of NMR and UV-vis data is more simplified as compared to previous donor-acceptor bistable [2]rotaxanes. This development has not only allowed for much better control over the position of the ring component in the ground state but also for control over the location of the CBPQT4+ ring during solution-state switching experiments, triggered either chemically (1H NMR) or electrochemically (cyclic voltammetry). In this instance, the use of the rigid spacer defines an unambiguous distance of 1.5 nm over which the ring moves between the MPTTF and NP units. The degenerate NP/NP [2]rotaxane was used to investigate the shuttling barrier by dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy for the movement of the CBPQT4+ ring across the new rigid spacer. It is evident from these measurements that the rigid spacer poses a much lower barrier to the 1.0 nm movement of the CBPQT4+ ring from one station to another as compared with previous systems-a finding that is thought to be a result of the combination of fewer favorable interactions between the spacer and the CBPQT4+ ring and a relatively unimpeded path between the two NP stations. This example augers well for exploiting rigidity during the development of well-defined bistable [2]rotaxanes, which are unencumbered by the excesses of structural conformations that have characterized the first generations of molecular switches based on the donor-acceptor recognition motif.",2007,0,91,0,7,15,10,7,7,12,1,5,4,5

Together, they move to the Golgi where SREBP is cleaved, releasing a fragment that activates genes encoding lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Sterols block ER exit, preventing cleavage, decreasing transcription, and achieving feedback control of lipid synthesis. Here, we report an in vitro system to measure incorporation of SCAP into ER vesicles. When membranes were isolated from sterol-depleted cells, SCAP entered vesicles in a reaction requiring nucleoside triphosphates and cytosol. SCAP budding was diminished in membranes from sterol-treated cells. Kinetics of induction of budding in vitro matched kinetics of ER exit in living cells expressing GFP-SCAP.

The resonances of the protons of the heme groups can be resolved because they are greatly shifted by hyperfine interactions with the unpaired electron of the heme iron. To a first approximation the heme resonances are similar for all the species studied but definite small variations were observed. These differences between the proton magnetic resonance spectra are not necessarily related to amino acid substitutions in contact with the heme group. This is interpreted to indicate that the molecular structure of hemoglobin is rather flexible, in that modifications of amino acid residues outside the immediate environment of the heme groups can affect the heme.",1970,8,15,0,1,3,5,0,0,2,1,0,0,0

In GVHD, lymphocytes formed the predominant cellular infiltrate. Lymphocytes indented the cytoplasmic membranes of enterocytes by point contact, extended broad pseudopods to the nuclear membranes of the enterocytes, and surrounded desmosomes. The membranes of target cells were never breached, however. We hypothesize that these lymphocyte-to-epithelial-cell contacts represent the recognition phase of alloimmune T-lymphocyte cytolysis. Damage to the enterocytes resulted in both coagulative necrosis and “apoptosis” (the development of membrane-bound cell fragments-“apoptotic bodies”). Epithelial injury and lymphocytic infiltration predominated in the bases of the crypts in mild GVHD and extended to the surface epithelium in severe GVHD. Chemoradiotherapy-induced injury, present early post-transplant, was diffuse and severe but transient. In GVHD, damage to the enterocytes, necrosis, and intercellular edema extended beyond the time of resolution of chemoradiotherapy-induced injuries. Patients without GVHD, studied after resolution of chemoradiation injury, had rectal epithelium with little or no injury and no evidence of either increased numbers of lymphocytes or of the intimate lymphocyte-to-epithelial-cell contacts described in those with GVHD.",1982,0,61,0,0,0,2,1,5,2,0,2,5,0

Inverse proximity suppresses the superconducting gap in superconducting leads in the vicinity of turnstile junctions, thus, trapping hot QPs in this region. An external magnetic field creates additional QP traps in the leads in the form of vortices or regions with a reduced superconducting gap resulting in the release of QPs away from the junctions. We present clear experimental evidence of the interplay of the inverse proximity effect and magnetic field revealing itself in the superconducting gap enhancement and significant improvement of the turnstile characteristics. The observed interplay and its theoretical explanation in the context of QP overheating are important for various superconducting and hybrid nanoelectronic devices, which find applications in quantum computation, photon detection, and quantum metrology.",2016,70,5,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

They usually bind two chromophores: flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which forms the active site, and a light-harvesting pigment, which is a 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate polyglutamate (MTHF) in most cases. In Escherichia coli photolyase (EcPhr), the MTHF cofactor is present in substoichiometric amounts after purification, while in Vibrio cholerae cryptochrome-1 (VcCry1) the MTHF cofactor is bound more strongly and is present at stoichiometric levels after purification. In this paper, we have used resonance Raman spectroscopy to monitor the effect of loss of MTHF on the protein-FAD interactions in EcPhr and to probe the protein-MTHF interactions in both EcPhr and VcCry1. We find that removal of MTHF does not perturb protein-FAD interactions, suggesting that it may not affect the physicochemical properties of FAD in EcPhr. Our data demonstrate that the pteridine ring of MTHF in EcPhr has different interactions with the protein matrix than that of MTHF in VcCry1. Comparison to solution resonance Raman spectra of MTHF suggests that the carbonyl of its pteridine ring in EcPhr experiences stronger hydrogen bonding and a more polar environment than in VcCry1, but that hydrogen bonding to the pteridine ring amine hydrogens is stronger in VcCry-1. These differences in hydrogen bonding may account for the higher binding affinity of MTHF in VcCry1 compared to EcPhr.",2007,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0

ee36c164703926eca3132230647c381a6d125cd2,Stimulation of brain membrane protein phosphorylation by calcium and an endogenous heat-stable protein,"THE important role of Ca2+ in the physiology of the nervous system is well documented1,2. However, the biochemical mechanisms underlying certain of its physiological effects, such as stimulus–secretion coupling3,4 and synthesis of cate-cholamines5,6, have not yet been elucidated. Calcium has been implicated in several biochemical reactions of potential importance to synaptic function. Thus, calcium and a heat-stable calcium-binding protein activate the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from mammalian brain7,8. The calcium-dependent regulator (CDR) from porcine brain9, bovine heart10 and bovine brain11 has been purified and characterised. CDR seems to be a calcium receptor as it binds calcium strongly and specifically. There is evidence that a CDR·Ca2+ complex is the true activator of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase12–14. A detergent-solubilised preparation of brain adenylate cyclase can also be activated by this calcium-binding protein15. Calcium stimulates protein phosphorylation in both intact16,17 and lysed18,19 synaptosomes and this cyclic nucleotide-independent mechanism may mediate or modulate some of the intracellular effects of Ca2+ on the function of presynaptic nerve terminals. We report here that calcium-dependent phosphorylation of synaptosomal membrane fractions from rat cerebral cortex requires an endogenous protein factor present in the synaptosomal cytoplasm. Calcium stimulated phosphorylation is lost on purification of synaptic membranes and can be effectively recovered by reconstitution with either the synaptosomal cytoplasm or with a purified preparation of CDR. Thus, regulation by calcium of calcium-dependent protein kinase activity may be mediated physiologically by the calcium-binding protein postulated to regulate cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and adenylate cyclase.",1978,25,283,1,3,24,34,25,38,14,14,26,8,12
9935ca773017dc74933e7b62ac7251c91007eadf,Kinetically E-Selective Macrocyclic Ring-Closing Metathesis,"Macrocyclic compounds are central to the development of new drugs, but preparing them can be challenging because of the energy barrier that must be surmounted in order to bring together and fuse the two ends of an acyclic precursor such as an alkene (also known as an olefin). To this end, the catalytic process known as ring-closing metathesis (RCM) has allowed access to countless biologically active macrocyclic organic molecules, even for large-scale production. Stereoselectivity is often critical in such cases: the potency of a macrocyclic compound can depend on the stereochemistry of its alkene; alternatively, one isomer of the compound can be subjected to stereoselective modification (such as dihydroxylation). Kinetically controlled Z-selective RCM reactions have been reported, but the only available metathesis approach for accessing macrocyclic E-olefins entails selective removal of the Z-component of a stereoisomeric mixture by ethenolysis, sacrificing substantial quantities of material if E/Z ratios are near unity. Use of ethylene can also cause adventitious olefin isomerization—a particularly serious problem when the E-alkene is energetically less favoured. Here, we show that dienes containing an E-alkenyl–B(pinacolato) group, widely used in catalytic cross-coupling, possess the requisite electronic and steric attributes to allow them to be converted stereoselectively to E-macrocyclic alkenes. The reaction is promoted by a molybdenum monoaryloxide pyrrolide complex and affords products at a yield of up to 73 per cent and an E/Z ratio greater than 98/2. We highlight the utility of the approach by preparing recifeiolide (a 12-membered-ring antibiotic) and pacritinib (an 18-membered-ring enzyme inhibitor), the Z-isomer of which is less potent than the E-isomer. Notably, the 18-membered-ring moiety of pacritinib—a potent anti-cancer agent that is in advanced clinical trials for treating lymphoma and myelofibrosis—was prepared by RCM carried out at a substrate concentration 20 times greater than when a ruthenium carbene was used.",2016,50,52,0,0,13,11,7,9,12,0,0,0,0

It is found that normally ordered power series exist and converge quite generally, but that for the case of antinormal ordering the required $c$-number coefficients are infinite for important classes of operators. A parametric ordering convention is introduced according to which normal, symmetric, and antinormal ordering correspond to the values $s=+1,0,\ensuremath{-}1$, respectively, of an order parameter $s$. In terms of this convention it is shown that for bounded operators the coefficients are finite when $sg0$, and the series are convergent when $sg\frac{1}{2}$. For each value of the order parameter $s$, a correspondence between operators and $c$-number functions is defined. Each correspondence is one-to-one and has the property that the function $f(\ensuremath{\alpha})$ associated with a given operator $F$ is the one which results when the operators $a$ and ${a}^{\ifmmode\dagger\else\textdagger\fi{}}$ occurring in the ordered power series for $F$ are replaced by their complex eigenvalues $\ensuremath{\alpha}$ and ${\ensuremath{\alpha}}^{*}$. The correspondence which is realized for symmetric ordering is the Weyl correspondence. The operators associated by each correspondence with the set of $\ensuremath{\delta}$ functions on the complex plane are discussed in detail. They are shown to furnish, for each ordering, an operator basis for an integral representation for arbitrary operators. The weight functions in these representations are simply the functions that correspond to the operators being expanded. The representation distinguished by antinormal ordering expresses operators as integrals of projection operators upon the coherent states, which is the form taken by the $P$ representation for the particular case of the density operator. The properties of the full set of representations are discussed and are shown to vary markedly with the order parameter $s$.",1969,0,691,21,1,0,2,3,3,3,4,6,3,3

Increased dietary intake of marine omega-3 fatty acids is associated with prolonged survival in patients with coronary heart disease. However, the mechanisms underlying this protective effect are poorly understood.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the association of omega-3 fatty acid blood levels with temporal changes in telomere length, an emerging marker of biological age.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Prospective cohort study of 608 ambulatory outpatients in California with stable coronary artery disease recruited from the Heart and Soul Study between September 2000 and December 2002 and followed up to January 2009 (median, 6.0 years; range, 5.0-8.1 years).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We measured leukocyte telomere length at baseline and again after 5 years of follow-up. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate the association of baseline levels of omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) with subsequent change in telomere length.


RESULTS
Individuals in the lowest quartile of DHA+EPA experienced the fastest rate of telomere shortening (0.13 telomere-to-single-copy gene ratio [T/S] units over 5 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.17), whereas those in the highest quartile experienced the slowest rate of telomere shortening (0.05 T/S units over 5 years; 95% CI, 0.02-0.08; P < .001 for linear trend across quartiles). Levels of DHA+EPA were associated with less telomere shortening before (unadjusted beta coefficient x 10(-3) = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.02-0.10) and after (adjusted beta coefficient x 10(-3) = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.08) sequential adjustment for established risk factors and potential confounders. Each 1-SD increase in DHA+EPA levels was associated with a 32% reduction in the odds of telomere shortening (adjusted odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47-0.98).


CONCLUSION
Among this cohort of patients with coronary artery disease, there was an inverse relationship between baseline blood levels of marine omega-3 fatty acids and the rate of telomere shortening over 5 years.",2010,70,297,5,21,33,33,41,25,15,31,24,24,17

To define the disposition of the v-erb-B protein within cells and across the plasma membrane, we raised antibodies against defined epitopes in the protein and used these in immunofluorescence to analyze cells transformed by v-erb-B. A small fraction of the v-erb-B protein was found on the plasma membrane in a clustered configuration. The bulk of the protein was located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Epitopes near the amino terminus of the v-erb-B protein were displayed on the surface of the cell, whereas epitopes in the protein kinase domain were located exclusively within cells.

In the Dunning R‐3327 rat prostate adenocarcinoma specimens, the receptors were characterized in untreated animals and following in vivo treatment with microcapsules of the agonist [D‐Trp6]‐LH‐RH and the somatostatin analog RC‐160. Two populations of binding sites were found for [D‐Trp6]‐LH‐RH, one with high affinity and low capacity and another with low affinity and high capacity. Treatment with [D‐Trp6]‐LH‐RH and RC‐160 alone or with the combination of these analogs increased the binding capacity (Bmax) of the low‐affinity binding sites for [D‐Trp6]‐LH‐RH and decreased Bmax for hPRL and EGF. Therapy with [D‐Trp6]‐LH‐RH also reduced Bmax of SS‐14 binding and dissociation binding constant of high‐affinity binding sites for [D‐Trp6]‐LH‐RH, whereas administration of RC‐160 or the combination treatment with both analogs increased Bmax of SS‐14 binding. These findings are compatible with the view that analogs of LH‐RH and SS‐14 might exert some direct inhibitory effects on the Dunning prostate cancer. Among 13 human BPH samples examined, only one had receptors for [D‐Trp6]‐LH‐RH, and seven specimens exhibited binding for prolactin. [D‐Trp6]‐LH‐RH receptors were found in all seven samples of human PC but not in any of the eight specimens of normal human prostate. All samples of normal human prostate, BPH, and human PC exhibited binding sites for EGF but not for SS‐14. Our findings on the membrane receptors in the human and rat prostate cancers raise the intriguing possibility that LH‐RH, acting as a growth factor, along with EGF and prolactin, might be involved in complex interactions that contribute to the promotion of prostate cancer in man.",1989,37,111,1,1,3,8,11,7,8,13,5,5,3

Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in CA3 pyramidal cells of hippocampal slices of 15‐ to 24‐day‐old rats (22 degrees C) using the whole‐cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. 2. Composite EPSCs were evoked by extracellular stimulation of the mossy fibre tract. Using the selective blockers 6‐cyano‐7‐nitroquinoxaline‐2,3‐dione (CNQX) and D‐2‐amino‐5‐phosphonopentanoic acid (APV), a major alpha‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methylisoxazole‐4‐propionate (AMPA)/kainate receptor‐mediated component and a minor NMDA receptor‐mediated component with slower time course were distinguished. For the AMPA/kainate receptor‐mediated component, the peak current‐voltage (I‐V) relation was linear, with a reversal potential close to 0 mV. The half‐maximal blocking concentration of CNQX was 353 nM. 3. Unitary EPSCs of the mossy fibre terminal (MF)‐CA3 pyramidal cell synapse were evoked at membrane potentials of ‐70 to ‐90 mV by low‐intensity extracellular stimulation of granule cell somata using fine‐tipped pipettes. The EPSC peak amplitude as a function of stimulus intensity showed all‐or‐none behaviour. The region of low threshold was restricted to a few micrometres. This suggests that extracellular stimulation was focal, and that the stimulus‐evoked EPSCs were unitary. 4. Latency and rise time histograms of EPSCs evoked by granule cell stimulation showed narrow unimodal distributions within each experiment. The mean latency was 4.2 +/‐ 1.0 ms, and the mean 20‐80% rise time was 0.6 +/‐ 0.1 ms (23 cells). When fitted within the range 0.7 ms to 20 ms after the peak, the decay of the EPSCs with the fastest rise (rise time 0.5 ms or less) could be described by a single exponential function; the mean time constant was in the range 3.0‐6.6 ms with a mean of 4.8 ms (8 cells). 5. Peak amplitudes of the EPSCs evoked by suprathreshold granule cell stimulation fluctuated between trials. The apparent EPSC peak conductance in normal extracellular solution (2 mM Ca2+, 1 mM Mg2+), excluding failures, was 1 nS. Reducing the Ca2+ concentration and increasing the Mg2+ concentration reduced the mean peak amplitude in a concentration‐dependent manner. 6. Peaks in EPSC peak amplitude distributions were apparent in low Ca2+ and high Mg2+. Using the criteria of equidistance and the presence of peaks and dips in the autocorrelation function, five of nine EPSC peak amplitude distributions were judged to be quantal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1993,0,669,86,2,14,25,30,34,37,32,31,26,26

It has been a matter of debate whether novel stimuli from the external world are instructive over the brain network to create de novo representations or, alternatively, are selecting from existing pre-representations hosted in preconfigured brain networks. The hippocampus is a brain area necessary for normal internally generated spatial–temporal representations and its dysfunctions have resulted in anterograde amnesia, impaired imagining of new experiences, and hallucinations. The compressed temporal sequence of place cell activity in the rodent hippocampus serves as an animal model of internal representation of the external space. Based on our recent results on the phenomenon of novel place cell sequence preplay, we submit that the place cell sequence of a novel spatial experience is determined, in part, by a selection of a set of cellular firing sequences from a repertoire of existing temporal firing sequences in the hippocampal network. Conceptually, this indicates that novel stimuli from the external world select from their pre-representations rather than create de novo our internal representations of the world.",2014,80,56,1,7,11,2,7,10,10,4,5,0,0

In this formulation, any gauge is equally acceptable and gives an identical description of the interaction between radiation and matter. The recent attempt by Feuchtwang et al. to achieve gauge invariance of probability amplitudes is in fact related to older work shown to suffer from path ambiguity in a line integral.",1983,14,6,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
4cb54671940de5b2321ed5e1389f732df867289f,A rapid and sensitive radioenzymatic assay for catechol estrogens in tissues.,Abstract A rapid and sensitive radioenzymatic assay for measuring catechol estrogens in tissue has been developed. This assay is based on converting the relatively labile catechol estrogens to stable O-methylated derivatives by the enzyme catechol-O-methyl-transferase. Using a radioactive methyl donor of high specific activity ( 3 H-S-adenosylmethionine) and solvent extraction with non-polar solvents a sensitivity of 25 pg can be achieved. The specificity of this assay was confirmed by thin layer chromatography and mass spectral analysis of the reaction products. Catechol estrogens in rat liver are significantly decreased after ovariectomy and markedly increased by treatment with estrogen.,1977,14,24,0,0,1,4,2,5,1,4,0,1,1

We have identified and characterised krapfen (kra) as a new member of the dorsal-group genes. kra encodes for the Drosophila homologue of MyD88, an adapter protein operating in the mammalian IL-1 pathway. Epistasis experiments reveal that kra acts between the receptor Toll and the cytoplasmic factor Tube. We show that there is a direct interaction between Kra and Tube presumably mediated by the death domains present in both proteins. Tube in turn interacts with its downstream effector Pelle through death domain association. We therefore suggest that upon Toll activation, Kra associates with Pelle and Tube, in an heterotrimeric complex.",2003,46,39,2,3,9,4,4,1,0,3,3,0,1

Follicles of 1 to 2 mm in diameter were mechanically dissected from ovaries of mature virgin rabbits before and 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours after intravenous injection of 100IU/kg of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Five to ten follicles from a rabbit were incubated with 100μCi of acetate-1-14C at a time and eighty follicles were taken for each time. Incorporation of acetate-14C into pregnenolone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 20α-dihydroprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, testosterone, estrone and estradiol-17β was assessed by the reverse dilution technique with recrystallization to constant specific activity. Overall incorporation of acetate-14C into the ten steroids was at its maximum 3 hours after hCG injection, decreased gradually up to 9 hours and diminished to its minimum level at 12 hours. The highest incorporation into C21 and C18 steroids was observed 2 hours after hCG injection, while that into C19 steroids occurred 6 hours after it. Distribution patterns of incorporation among the individual steroids varied with time, although a preovulatory rise and fall in 14C incorporation was observed for all steroids analysed. Estradiol-17 β, testosterone and androstenedione were the major products in 0 hour follicles, while C21 steroids were predominant at the first 3 hours with 17-hydroxyprogesterone and pregnenolone the major products. C21 and C19 steroids were actively synthesized between 6 and 9 hours, when pregnenolone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone were the principal steroids. At the 12th hour after hCG injection, the three androgenic steroids were clearly the major products.

This paper concentrates on data assembly, analysis, and the estimate of the various foreground contributions; the companion Letter presents the cosmological results for the CIB fluctuations and their implications. By using repeated observations of a specific calibration star field, we were able to achieve integration times in excess of 3900 s, compared to the 7.8 s in the standard 2MASS data product. This yielded a point-source detection limit (3 σ) of +18.5 mag in the Ks band. The resulting co-added images were processed to remove point sources to a limiting surface brightness of +20 mag arcsec-2 or 40 nW m-2 sr-1. The remaining maps contained over 90% of the pixels and were Fourier transformed to study the spatial structure of the diffuse background light. After removing resolved sources and other artifacts, we find that the power spectrum of the final images has a power-law distribution consistent with clustering by distant galaxies. We estimate here the contributions to this signal from Galactic foregrounds, atmospheric OH-glow, zodiacal light, and instrument noise, all of which are small and of different slopes. This supports the identification offered in the companion Letter of the signal as coming from the CIB fluctuations produced by distant clustered galaxies.",2002,51,29,2,0,2,2,3,1,1,0,3,1,2

Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites. Here we show that amino acids regulate the N-terminal phosphorylation sites in 4E-BP1 through the RAIP motif in a rapamycin-insensitive manner. Several criteria indicate this reflects a rapamycin-insensitive output from mTOR. In contrast, the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the C-terminal site Ser64/65 is generally sensitive to rapamycin, as is phosphorylation of another well-characterized target for mTOR signaling, S6K1. Our data imply that it is unlikely that mTOR directly phosphorylates Thr69/70 in 4E-BP1. Although 4E-BP1 and S6K1 bind the mTOR partner, raptor, our data indicate that the outputs from mTOR to 4E-BP1 and S6K1 are distinct. In cells, efficient phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 requires it to be able to bind to eIF4E, whereas phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR in vitro shows no such preference. These data have important implications for understanding signaling downstream of mTOR and the development of new strategies to impair mTOR signaling.",2005,86,219,8,0,14,23,25,29,18,17,20,16,18

When monocytes are depleted from the stimulator population, it is evident that small numbers of allogeneic dendritic cells form multicellular aggregates with responsive T cells. B cells and monocytes in allogeneic stimulator populations do not appear to form aggregates in the first 2 days of the MLR. Upon return to culture, most of the lymphocytes that have clustered with dendritic cells become IL-2 responsive, proliferating lymphoblasts. The nonclustered cells exhibit little growth, while mixtures of clusters and nonclusters proliferate comparably to clusters alone. Cluster-derived lymphocytes respond rapidly to rechallenge with foreign leukocytes from the original donor but are greater than 90% depleted of reactivity to other ""third party"" donors. Nonclustered lymphocytes, in contrast, are greater than 90% depleted in specific reactivity but respond normally to third party. Therefore antigen-specific (alloreactive) resting CD4+ lymphocytes efficiently and selectively aggregate with dendritic cells. Dendritic-T-cell aggregates represent a stable microenvironment in which the MLR begins and might be useful in the experimental analysis of early events in the sensitization phase of cell-mediated immunity in man.",1988,16,88,1,5,9,6,1,6,6,5,5,6,5

In this report we show that dimeric and trimeric forms of closed circular DNA are present, in addition to the previously characterized, predominant monomeric species. The identities of these oligomeric circular molecules were verified by their characteristic behavior during equilibrium centrifugation in cesium chloride-propidium diiodide gradients, rate-zonal centrifugation in sucrose gradients, and electrophoresis in agarose gels, before and after digestion with nucleases. Restriction endonuclease cleavage of isolated dimeric and trimeric molecules indicates that they consist of monomers linked in a “head-to-tail” orientation.",1980,26,13,0,0,2,0,6,0,1,0,1,0,1

A quantitative estimate of the error is derived, and it is shown that the error may correspond to a large factor, even when the gas is well inside the classical regime. For 1 cm3 of He at 300K and atmospheric pressure this factor exceeds 1013. However, all observables of the gas involve the logarithm of the partition function, rather than the partition function itself. The fractional error in the logarithm is negligible, hence the classical treatment leads in the end to correct answers for all observables.",1980,0,6,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
db2e8e459017482e1efa453df1db0f56421a8d01,The Euplotes La motif protein p43 has properties of a telomerase-specific subunit.,"Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase synthesizing DNA repeats at telomeres. In addition to the RNA and catalytic protein components, telomerase from the ciliate Euplotes aediculatus contains the subunit p43. This protein is homologous to the La autoantigen, functioning in maturation of RNA polymerase III transcripts. Here we provide evidence that p43 is primarily associated with the telomerase ribonucleoprotein in vivo. Recombinant p43 binds telomerase RNA with low-nanomolar affinity in vitro, recognizing stem I and adjacent nucleotides or structures in the core of the RNA. Unlike authentic La proteins, p43 does not bind strongly to RNA polymerase III precursor transcripts and does not exhibit a marked binding preference for 3'-terminal oligouridylate residues. In isolated macronuclei, p43 largely colocalizes with telomerase RNA in discrete foci. These findings suggest that p43 is not the Euplotes La protein but instead plays a dedicated role in telomerase assembly and/or function. Thus, p43 joins the telomerase reverse transcriptase and the yeast proteins Est1p and Est3p as the only telomerase-specific proteins identified so far.",2003,0,53,3,2,5,2,3,5,1,4,5,4,6

The contour map of BaBr{sup +} flux obtained for the ground-state reaction at 1.1-eV collision energy showed a backscattered angular distribution (relative to the barium beam) with a substantial fraction of the available energy appearing in translation. Laser excitation strongly inhibited this channel at 1.1 eV. These experimental observations suggest that for the chemiion reaction head-on, collinear collisions and proximal crossings of the potential energy surfaces are necessary to preclude escape into the dominant neutral pathways. At 1.6-eV collision energy potential energy surfaces are necessary to preclude escape into the dominant neutral pathways. At 1.6-eV collision energy a new laser-dependent source of BaBr{sup +} appeared. This laser-enhanced BaBr{sup +} showed a laboratory angular distribution substantially narrower than for the ground-state reaction, indicating a smaller translational energy release. The angular distribution was {approximately}70% backscattered and displayed a clear dip at the center of mass. This new BaBr{sup +}, produced from electronically excited barium at higher translational energy, is ascribed to secondary collisions of BaBr+Br initially formed inmore » low impact parameter collisions.

acb70f03fc7fdc4a547e23d76ac74be770e78a5d,The total synthesis of chlorophyll a,"The total synthesis of chlorophyll a starting from Knorr's pyrrole (1) is described with full experimental detail. Forty six stages are involved to reach the target molecule, chlorin e6 trimethyl ester (46), from which the preparation of chlorophyll a has already been described. 
 
The four pyrroles which are required for rings A, B, C and D are elaborated largely by known reactions, although with considerable improvements. These pyrroles are manipulated to give two dipyrrin derivatives: a left-hand component (26, comprising rings A and D) and a right-hand component (the thioaldehyde 31, comprising rings B and C). These are brought together in a carefully controlled, stepwise, condensation to give a single porphyrin product (35) in 50% yield. This synthesis of an unsymmetrically-substituted porphyrin bearing an electron-withdrawing substituent and a meso-substituent is seen as a very considerable advance, both in conceptual and practical terms, over earlier approaches. During the course of the closure of the macrocycle, intermediates which exemplify a new group of dihydroporphyrins, the phlorins (e.g. 34), are recognised. 
 
Eleven steps remain. The porphyrin (35) is shown to undergo dehydrogenation (again via a phlorin intermediate) on brief treatment with acetic acid in air to give the meso-crylic acid derivative (36), which in acetic acid under nitrogen at 110° slowly reaches equilibrium with the purpurin (37). The introduction of the reactive vinyl group at C-3 has been delayed until this point in the synthesis. Photo-oxygenation of the product, the vinylpurpurin (38), cleaves the cyclopenteno-ring giving the methoxalylpurpurin (39). A reverse Claisen reaction now generates the methoxylactone, rac-isopurpurin 5 methyl ester (40), the first substance in this synthetic series which can be compared with a sample (albeit optically active) derived from natural chlorophyll a. rac-Isopurpurin 5 methyl ester (40) is hydrolysed to the lactol, chlorin 5 (41), which is resolved (diastereoisomeric salts with quinine). The less soluble salt gives synthetic act-chlorin 5, identical with a sample of natural provenance. Diazomethane treatment of the free acid (42) yields purpurin 5 dimethyl ester (43), again identical with the naturally-derived compound. Treatment with hydrogen cyanide in triethylamine leads to the cyanolactone (44), reductive cleavage and methylation of which give the chlorin e6 nitrile (45). Methanolysis of this furnishes synthetic crystalline chlorin e6 trimethyl ester (46), identical (mp, mixed mp, electronic spectrum, infra red spectrum) with a naturally-derived sample, so completing the total synthesis.",1990,61,135,1,1,5,2,6,0,7,5,4,4,0
4d1f4d19f154c453800bb00d66720d15f258beff,A small region of the beta-adrenergic receptor is selectively involved in its rapid regulation.,"Plasma membrane receptors that couple to guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) undergo a variety of rapid (minutes) and longer term (hours) regulatory processes induced by ligands. For the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR), the rapid processes include functional desensitization, mediated by phosphorylation of the receptor by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, as well as a loss of hydrophilic ligand binding proposed to represent sequestration of receptors into a cellular compartment distinct from the plasma membrane. The slower processes include beta 2AR down-regulation (i.e., a decrease in the total cellular complement of receptors). It is not yet known whether beta 2AR phosphorylation and/or sequestration are prerequisites for down-regulation of the receptor. Like other G protein-coupled receptors, the beta 2AR molecule spans the plasma membrane seven times, and the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain has been proposed to contain molecular determinants for each of these regulatory processes. We replaced four serine and threonine residues located within a 10-amino acid segment of this domain of beta 2AR and thereby prevented agonist-promoted phosphorylation, sequestration, and rapid desensitization of the adenylyl cyclase response. In contrast, these mutations did not affect functional coupling to the stimulatory G protein Gs or long-term down-regulation. These findings thus define a small, hitherto unappreciated region of the receptor molecule that may selectively subserve its rapid regulation. In addition, with the demonstration that beta 2AR does not have to be phosphorylated or sequestered in order to enter the down-regulation pathway, the results suggest that the classical receptor endocytosis model may not be appropriate for beta 2AR regulation.",1991,0,142,4,0,3,5,8,19,12,10,15,5,9

The levels of tyrosine, dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured after 15 min of ischemia as well as after 30 min of recirculation. In separate experiments (70% N2O) the rate of accumulation of DOPA and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) was determined in three different brain regions (striatum, limbic forebrain and hemispheres) during recirculation. During ischemia, the monoamine pattern was unaffected. Following recirculation, increases in DA, 5-HIAA, tyrosine and tryptophan were found irrespective of the type of anesthesia used. Pronounced postischemic decreases in NA and 5-HT were observed in animals anesthetized with nitrous oxide but not in those given phenobarbitone. During recirculation the rate of tyrosine hydroxylation increased in all three brain regions while tryptophan hydroxylation was reduced.

Well-defined, rather complex surface layer patterns emerge resulting from a delicate balance of (self-) complementary (strong) hydrogen bonds and van der Waals force-driven ordering of the alkyl substituents on the HOPG surface. The four different compounds and their 1:1 mixtures yield seven different 2D structures. Phthalhydrazide offers in principle three tautomeric forms, with the lactim/lactam being the most stable. Depending on the solvent, different morphologies can be obtained. In one case, the special self-assembly of achiral 1a leads to a 2D chiral packing with the left- and right-hand motifs present in different domains. We assume that pure 1a is expressed in its lactim/lactam form, whereas in a 1:1 mixture with 2a it switches to the bislactam form.

The recently reported association of Nef with an unidentified serine kinase provides a clue as to how Nef might exert its effects. Considering the key role of protein kinase C (PKC) in T cell activation, we investigated the possibility that Nef interacts with PKC. Our results, using two approaches for detecting interactions between Nef and PKC isozymes in Jurkat cells, show that Nef interacts preferentially with θPKC. The interaction of Nef and θPKC is independent of calcium, enhanced by phospholipid activators of PKC and not affected by a PKC pseudosubstrate peptide. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin stimulation of Jurkat cells expressing Nef fails to produce the usual translocation of θPKC from the cytosol to the particulate fraction; translocation of βPKC and εPKC was unaffected. Indeed, there appears to be a net loss of θPKC in Nef-expressing cells following stimulation.

Radioiodinated RSA (125I-RSA) binding to the cells reached equilibrium at approximately 20 min incubation. Albumin binding was a slowly saturating function over concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 50 mg/ml. Specific RSA binding with a moderate apparent affinity constant of 1.0 mg/ml and with a maximum binding concentration of 90 ng/cm2 was immunolocalized with anti-RSA antibody to the outer (free) side of the endothelium. Scatchard analysis of the binding yielded a nonlinear binding curve with a concave-upward shape. Dissociation rate analysis supports negative cooperativity of albumin binding, but multiple binding sites may also be present. Albumin binding fulfilled many requirements for ligand specificity including saturability, reversibility, competibility, and dependence on both cell type and cell number. The results are discussed in terms of past in situ investigations on the localization of albumin binding to vascular endothelium and its effect on transendothelial molecular transport.",1988,0,89,2,1,9,1,5,4,8,4,3,2,3

Molecular finger-printing has demonstrated a degree of heterogeneity between different strains of virus. It is probable that exogenous reinfection with different strains and endogenous reactivation are commonplace events, although usually asymptomatic. The lability of the endogenous interaction inversely parallels the responsiveness of the cell-mediated immune system--a major factor in viral containment by the human host. Thus, the therapeutic use of immunosuppressive or cytotoxic substances increases the morbidity and mortality associated with varicella-zoster.

Molecular modeling followed by optical, electron, and x-ray diffraction studies of a synthetic poly(L-glutamine) shows that it forms beta-sheets strongly held together by hydrogen bonds. Glutamine repeats may function as polar zippers, for example, by joining specific transcription factors bound to separate DNA segments.

fa55301e38ce72a449b7a08efef23fa4470211e7,Arsenite transport by mammalian aquaglyceroporins AQP7 and AQP9,"Much is known about the transport of arsenite and antimonite into microbes, but the identities of mammalian transport proteins are unknown. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae FPS1 gene encodes a membrane protein homologous to the bacterial aquaglyceroporin GlpF and to mammalian aquaglyceroporins AQP7 and AQP9. Fps1p mediates glycerol uptake and glycerol efflux in response to hypoosmotic shock. Fps1p has been shown to facilitate uptake of the metalloids arsenite and antimonite, and the Escherichia coli homolog, GlpF, facilitates the uptake and sensitivity to metalloid salts. In this study, the ability of mammalian aquaglyceroporins AQP7 and AQP9 to substitute for the yeast Fps1p was examined. The fps1Δ strain of S. cerevisiae exhibits increased tolerance to arsenite and antimonite compared to a wild-type strain. Introduction of a plasmid containing AQP9 reverses the metalloid tolerance of the deletion strain. AQP7 was not expressed in yeast. The fps1Δ cells exhibit reduced transport of 73As(III) or 125Sb(III), but uptake is enhanced by expression of AQP9. Xenopus laevis oocytes microinjected with either AQP7 or AQP9 cRNA exhibited increased transport of 73As(III). These results suggest that AQP9 and AQP7 may be a major routes of arsenite uptake into mammalian cells, an observation potentially of large importance for understanding the action of arsenite as a human toxin and carcinogen, as well as its efficacy as a chemotherapeutic agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia.",2002,46,446,13,4,14,27,28,25,30,21,36,31,20

8c5c49c8fe297e135e5f6fc5da7f3769dad2896d,Why ion pair reversal by protein engineering is unlikely to succeed,"Genetic engineering is a powerful tool for exploring correlations between structure and function in proteins, but as yet we are unable to use it for effective protein design. One of the most interesting examples, which would seem to be obvious, is reversing the polarity of an ion pair. Changing a positively charged protein group, that provides a strong binding for negative substrates, to a negative group is expected to provide an effective binding site for a positively charged substrate. But several recent experiments on aspartate aminotransferase1,2, trypsin3 and aspartate transcarbamoylase (Schachman, H. K. personal communication) have indicated that polarity reversal is not so successful. Here we argue that the same factors that make the enzyme an effective system for the (−+) pair will make it a much less effective system for the ( +−)pair. We also point out that the unusually low effective dielectric constant (ɛ ≃ 13) for the (−+) interaction is due to its microenviron-ment and this will destabilize a (+−) arrangement having an entirely different dielectric constant (ɛ ≃ 80). The calculations presented here evaluate the energetics of ion pairs in protein active sites on a semiquantitative level. This is particularly important when dealing with strong, functionally important interactions that are difficult to evaluate with macroscopic models.",1988,20,72,2,0,2,5,3,2,3,3,6,3,3

Starting with plant tissue from Zea mays var. mutin recombinant GST-I was prepared by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. The enzyme was crystallized in the presence of lactoylglutathione, a ligand formerly never observed in a GST structure and known as an intermediate of the pharmacologically relevant glyoxalase system. The crystal structure of GST-I has been determined at 2.5 A resolution and exhibits the GST-typical dimer of two identical subunits, each consisting of 214 residues. Compared with other plant GSTs the three-dimensional structure of GST-I primarily shows structural differences in the hydrophobic substrate binding site, the linker segment and the C-terminal region. Furthermore, a comparison of the ligand-bound GST-I structure with the apo structure of GST-III indicates the movement of a ten-residue loop upon binding of the ligand to the active site. This is the first structure-based evidence for an induced fit mechanism of glutathione S-transferases, which has previously been postulated for class pi enzymes. Together with GST-III, GST-I may explain herbicide resistance and selectivity in maize as well as in other agronomic relevant crops.",1997,31,97,4,1,4,5,5,7,3,3,6,5,3

It has been suggested that this residue is directly involved in electron transfer between cytochrome c and cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP)3 and may also control the polarity of the haem environment4. Because Phe residues are not susceptible to chemical modification, no direct means of studying the functional role of Phe 87 has been available, so we have chosen Phe 87 as our initial target here to test the feasibility of using site-directed mutagenesis5 as a means of studying structure–function relationships in cytochrome c. We have changed the codon for Phe 87 to that of either a Ser, a Tyr or a Gly. The mutated genes have been introduced6 into a yeast strain7 lacking both isozymes of cytochrome c. Unlike the recipient strain, transformants grow on a non-fermentable carbon source, indicating that the mutant proteins can reduce cytochrome oxidase7. The purified mutant proteins are similar to wild type with respect to their visible spectra8, 20–70% as active as wild-type protein in the CCP assay9, and their reduction potentials are lowered by as much as 50 mV. Thus Phe 87 is not essential for cytochrome c to transfer electrons but is involved in determining the reduction potential.",1985,26,125,1,4,7,7,14,10,9,14,8,7,8

The R I cleavage product of the “super sensitive” form is one-third the physical size of simian virus 40 DNA (10.4 S) and reassociates about three times more rapidly than “standard” viral DNA. To identify the portions of the DAR genome present in the 10.4 S segment, the plus strand of each of the 11 fragments of 32 P-labeled simian virus 40 DNA, produced by cleavage with the Hemophilus influenzae restriction endonuclease, was hybridized in solution with the sheared R I cleavage product of the “supersensitive” class of viral DNA. Reaction was observed with fragments located in two distinct regions of the simian virus 40 genome: (1) Hin -A and C; (2) Hin -G, J, F and K. Further studies indicated that simian virus 40 complementary RNA transcribed in vitro with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase from one strand of simian virus 40 DNA reacts with both strands of the denatured 10.4 S cleavage product when hybridization is monitored with hydroxyapatite. Treatment of the 10.4 S DNA-simian virus 40 cRNA hybrid with the single-strand spcific nuclease, S 1 , converted approximately 50% of the radioactive counts to an acid-soluble product. These results indicate that the 10.4 S product contains a transposition of sequences originally present on one of the DAR DNA strands to the other strand. Examination of heteroduplexes formed between the 10.4 S segment and unique linear forms of DAR DNA produced with the R · Eco RI restriction endonuclease have confirmed these observations. Thus it appears that a molecular rearrangement(s) has resulted in the recombination and inversion of viral DNA sequences from two separate loci on the parental DAR genome. This 1.1 × 10 6 dalton segment is reiterated three times in a supercoiled molecule equivalent in physical size to parental DAR DNA.",1974,25,44,0,3,8,7,8,5,3,2,2,0,0

requires the accurate assessment of the s-process reaction flow. The daughter
nucleus 187Os as well as its immediate s-only neighbor 186Os are shielded from
the r-process. Therefore, the radiogenic contribution to 187Os can be derived
via the local approximation of the s-process, which is well justified in this
mass region: ( σ Ns)187 = ( σ Ns)186. Accordingly, accurate Maxwellianaveraged
(n, γ ) cross sections have to be known for 186Os and 187Os over the
full range of s-process temperatures. Because 187Os has low-lying excited
states, which are significantly populated during the s-process, neutron captures
on these excited states have to be properly taken into account. The input
for the corresponding Hauser–Feshbach calculations can be constrained by
deriving the strength functions from a detailed resonance analysis of the
measured (n, γ ) cross sections as well as by an additional measurement of
the inelastic scattering cross section for the first exited level, which dominates
the competition between the capture and scattering channels. This contribution
reports on measurements of the neutron capture cross sections of 186Os, 187Os
and 188Os from the eV region to 1MeV at the CERN/n TOF facility and of the
inelastic scattering cross section of 187Os around 30 keV at the Karlsruhe

If the lowest-energy excited states are strongly bound excitons (electron–hole pairs in singlet or triplet spin states), this theoretical upper limit is only 25% of the corresponding quantum efficiency for photoluminescence: an electron in the π*-band and a hole (or missing electron) in the π-band can form a triplet with spin multiplicity of three, or a singlet with spin multiplicity of one, but only the singlet will decay radiatively. But if the electron–hole binding energy is sufficiently weak, the ratio of the maximum quantum efficiencies for electroluminescence and photoluminescence can theoretically approach unity. Here we report a value of ∼50% for the ratio of these efficiencies (electroluminescence:photoluminescence) in polymer light-emitting diodes, attained by blending electron transport materials with the conjugated polymer to improve the injection of electrons. This value significantly exceeds the theoretical limit for strongly bound singlet and triplet excitons, assuming they comprise the lowest-energy excited states.

We have identified the protein Xenopus nuclear factor 7 (Xnf7) as a novel APC inhibitor able to regulate the timing of exit from mitosis. Immunodepletion of Xnf7 from Xenopus laevis egg extracts accelerated the degradation of APC substrates cyclin B1, cyclin B2, and securin upon release from cytostatic factor arrest, whereas excess Xnf7 inhibited APC activity. Interestingly, Xnf7 exhibited intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity, and this activity was required for APC inhibition. Unlike other reported APC inhibitors, Xnf7 did not associate with Cdc20, but rather bound directly to core subunits of the APC. Furthermore, Xnf7 was required for spindle assembly checkpoint function in egg extracts. These data suggest that Xnf7 is an APC inhibitor able to link spindle status to the APC through direct association with APC core components.",2005,63,26,1,1,6,3,4,1,3,0,4,2,0

The crystal structure has been obtained from diffraction data at 3 A resolution, with phases originally from isomorphous replacement. The electron density map was substantially improved by cyclic averaging of the electron densities of the two crystal forms and allowed the chain to be traced in terms of the known chemical amino acid sequence. Energy restrained crystallographic refinement was initiated and resulted in conventional R-values of 0.251 for the tetragonal crystal form (6 to 3 A resolution) and 0.247 for the hexagonal crystal form (6 to 3.2 A resolution). The polypeptide chain is almost completely arranged in well-defined secondary structural elements: three beta-sheets and eight alpha-helices. The helices are preferentially formed by the first 150 residues. They are in proximity underneath sheet A. The chain ends Met358 and Ser359 of the nicked species are arranged in strands on opposite ends of the molecule indicating a major structural rearrangement upon modification of the intact inhibitor. It is suggested that the Met358 strand is in a different conformation removed from sheet A and approaches Ser359 in the intact inhibitor species. Glu342, which is exchanged by a lysine in the Z-variant is in a strategic position for such a rearrangement. The three carbohydrate chains of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor have partly defined electron density close to their attachment sites at asparagine residues.

Here we use a genetic approach to identify molecules specific to GABA function. On the basis of the known in vivo roles of GABAergic neurons in controlling behaviour of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans 2, we identified mutants defective in GABA-mediated behaviours. Five genes are necessary either for GABAergic neuronal differentiation or for pre- or postsynaptic GABAergic function. The gene unc-30 is required for the differentiation of a specific type of GABAergic neuron, the type-D inhibitory motor neuron. The gene unc-25 is necessary for GABA expression and probably encodes the GABA biosynthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. The genes unc-46 and unc-47 seem to be required for normal GABA release. Finally, the gene unc-49 is apparently necessary postsynaptically for the inhibitory effect of GABA on the body muscles and might encode a protein needed for the function of a GABAA-like receptor.

Detection of proteinase K-resistant prion protein (PrPSc) still represents the diagnostic gold standard for prion diseases in humans, sheep and cattle. However, it has become increasingly apparent that the accumulation of PrPSc does not always accompany prion infections: high titers of prion infectivity can be reached also in the absence of protease resistant PrPSc. Here, we describe a structural basis for the phenomenon of protease-sensitive prion infectivity. We studied the effect on proteinase K (PK) resistance of the amino acid substitution Y169F, which removes a single oxygen atom from the β2–α2 loop of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). When infected with RML or the 263K strain of prions, transgenic mice lacking wild-type (wt) PrPC but expressing MoPrP169F generated prion infectivity at levels comparable to wt mice. The newly generated MoPrP169F prions were biologically indistinguishable from those recovered from prion-infected wt mice, and elicited similar pathologies in vivo. Surprisingly, MoPrP169F prions showed greatly reduced PK resistance and density gradient analyses showed a significant reduction in high-density aggregates. Passage of MoPrP169F prions into mice expressing wt MoPrP led to full recovery of protease resistance, indicating that no strain shift had taken place. We conclude that a subtle structural variation in the β2–α2 loop of PrPC affects the sensitivity of PrPSc to protease but does not impact prion replication and infectivity. With these findings a specific structural feature of PrPC can be linked to a physicochemical property of the corresponding PrPSc.",2017,54,5,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Using the coincidence method we find for magnetic fields up to 28 T that the spin splitting can be as large as 5 times the Landau splitting. We find a value of the g-factor of about 13. For small even-integer filling factors the corresponding minima in the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations cannot be tuned into maxima for arbitrary tilt angles. This indicates the anti-crossing of neighboring Landau and spin levels. Furthermore we find for particular tilt angles a crossover from even-integer dominated Shubnikov-de Haas minima to odd-integer minima as a function of magnetic field.,2000,0,35,1,1,0,1,2,6,4,2,0,1,1

Failure of cells damaged under osmotic protection to lyse in EDTA or at low temperature after removal of osmotic protection.,"Abstract The extent of damage to cell membranes induced by specific antibody and complement under various conditions was monitored by leakage from the cells of isotopically labeled molecules of three sizes. The results have revealed that cells which have sustained complement-mediated membrane damage (indicated by loss of electrolytes) do not, in the absence of osmotic protection, proceed to undergo rapid colloid osmotic lysis, provided that (1) the primary complement-mediated damage was sustained in osmotically protective medium, (2) the damage was of limited extent, and (3) complement activity is stopped (by EDTA or low temperature) prior to removal of osmotic protection so that additional new damage is not done after the removal of osmotic protection. This was found both for mouse ascites tumor cells and erythrocytes. Moreover, the results suggest striking differences in the effect of low temperature on the lytic process in nucleated cells as compared with erythrocytes. In addition to the above-mentioned effects, low temperature can apparently prevent leakage of molecules as small as amino acids from damaged nucleated cells (but not from erythrocytes) in the absence of ostomic protection, no matter how extensive the previous (prelytic) complement-mediated damage, and irrespective of whether the cells were osmotically protected while the damage was administered. These findings have two, perhaps unrelated implications. First, low temperature has a striking ability to restrict further loss of intracellular constituents from damaged nucleated cells (but not from erythrocytes). Second, the results with nucleated cells and erythrocytes raise the possibility that the primary complement-induced lytic lesion either reseals spontaneously or is capable of being repaired.",1975,19,29,0,1,2,4,1,1,1,1,1,2,0

By using antibodies raised against the N-terminal region of APC protein, we have detected the variable masses of endogenous APC proteins in individual cell lines established from human colorectal carcinomas caused by nonsense mutations of the gene. Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitates of full-length and truncated APC were observed in in vitro kinase reaction, indicating association of APC with protein kinase activity. The kinase activity complexed with APC was sensitive to heparin and used GTP as phosphoryl donor, suggesting an involvement of casein kinase 2 (CK2). Both CK2α- and β-subunits were found to associate with APC in immunoprecipitates as well as in pull-down assays, with preferential interaction of APC with tetrameric CK2 holoenzyme. In synchronized cell populations, the association of APC with CK2 was cell cycle dependent, with the highest association in G2/M. Unexpectedly, APC immunoprecipitates containing full-length APC protein inhibited CK2 in vitro, whereas immunoprecipitates of truncated APC had little effect. This was confirmed by using recombinant APC, and the inhibitory region was localized to the C terminus of APC between residues 2086 and 2394. Overexpression of this fragment in SW480 cells suppressed cell proliferation rates as well as tumorigenesis. These results demonstrate a previously uncharacterized functional interaction between the tumor suppressor protein APC and CK2 and suggest that growth-inhibitory effects of APC may be regulated by inhibition of CK2.",2002,28,62,4,0,3,2,6,5,1,6,5,4,1

bb5409b7cae45978946665e04ee002d852e20125,High repetition rate cryogenic disk laser for OPCPA,"The cryogenic disk laser has been developed with a high energy capacity and average power and possibility of using this laser as a pump source for OPCPA amplification is discussed. Keywords—cryogenic disk laser; Yb:YAG, pulse disortions OPCPA ampification; The increasing of repetition rate is one of main topics of modern femtosecond lasers and basic limitation is the absence of high capacity and high repetition rate pump sources. Due to effective heat removal, weak self-focusing and high optical efficiency, thin disk lasers may be excellent pump source for high intensity lasers based on OPCPA. For today, output parameters of thin disk lasers has been reached sub-kW average power and hundreds mJ of pulse energy, but a high pulse energy and a high repetition rate together are not still demonstrated. One way to solve this problem is the cryogenic cooling of disk shaped active elements that strongly improve its laser and thermooptical characteristics and allows to increase an output energy to multi-J range at repetition rate near 1 kHz [1]. The current results of high capacity and high power cryogenic disk laser development in the IAPRAS (Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia) and its possible using as pump source for OPCPA are presented in this work. Fig. 1. Fig.1. Cooling scheme of Yb:YAG/YAG composite active element (a) and cryogenic disk laser head (b) The theoretical model of amplification in disk shaped active element has been developed with taking to account strongly non uniform heat release, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and multi-pass scheme of amplification. Experimentally and theoretically shown, that ASE effect may be strongly reduced in composite active elements with undoped cup and cladding [2] and new technique of thermal diffusion bonding is developed to fabricate active elements with undoped cup [3]. Another difficulty in cryogenic lasers is boiling of liquid nitrogen at high pump power. Based on technologies of room temperature disk laser, we are developed the cryogenic disk laser head with active micro channel cooling by liquid nitrogen (fig.1). It is already allowed to provide more 1 kW of pump power with negligible thermal distortions of the laser beam. The current design of our laser system is described below. Thin disk laser with 6 ns output pulses at 1 kHz is used as a seed laser. After that, signal is amplified in three cascades of amplification. Cryogenic disk laser heads are used in last two stages of laser to provide a high level of CW pump power. Amplification from few mkJ up to 0.1 J at 1 kHz is achieved currently at half pump power and main limitation is parasite lasing caused by strong ASE. Composite active elements with undoped cup and cladding are under development now to suppress this effect. Note, the OPCPA technique is very sensitive to temporal, spatial and spectral pump pulse profiles. This problem was investigated experimentally and theoretically and shown that it is possible to amplify multi ps pulses in cryogenic disk laser by CPA technique. Minimal pulse duration may be ~ 2 ps that corresponds 0.7 nm spectral range. Multipass geometry of disk amplifiers provides a minimal pulse front rolling and very uniform spatial beam distribution closed to pump beam. A powerful femtosecond laser will be developed on the base of achieved results. A fiber femtosecond laser will be used as a seed source. One part of a seed signal will be used for further amplification in cryogenic disk laser up to 1 Joule, another part will be amplified by using OPCPA technique with a pumping from cryogenic disk laser. This femtosecond system will be used for more careful adjusting of cryogenic disk laser output parameters from the point of view OPCPA amplification and further scaling to multi-Joules range.

This family of proteins is characterized by containing three tandem homologous sequence repeats of approximately 100 amino acids, each folded into two transmembrane alpha-helices linked by an extensive polar loop. Each repeat contains a characteristic conserved sequence. These features have been used to determine the extent of the family in genome sequences. The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains 34 members of the family. The identity of five of them was known before the determination of the genome sequence, but the functions of the remaining family members were not. This review describes how the functions of 15 of these previously unknown transport proteins have been determined by a strategy that consists of expressing the genes in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, reconstituting the gene products into liposomes and establishing their functions by transport assay. Genetic and biochemical evidence as well as phylogenetic considerations have guided the choice of substrates that were tested in the transport assays. The physiological roles of these carriers have been verified by genetic experiments. Various pieces of evidence point to the functions of six additional members of the family, but these proposals await confirmation by transport assay. The sequences of many of the newly identified yeast carriers have been used to characterize orthologs in other species, and in man five diseases are presently known to be caused by defects in specific mitochondrial carrier genes. The roles of eight yeast mitochondrial carriers remain to be established.",2006,102,146,6,3,4,8,10,13,11,13,13,17,11

Unsensitized sheep cells suspended in sugar solutions are agglutinated by electrolytes whenever the potential is depressed to 6 millivolts or less, except in the case of MgCl2 or CaCl2. 2. With these salts no agglutination occurs although there is practically no potential. The presence of these salts prevents acid agglutination. This is presumably due to a decrease in the ""cohesion"" between the cells. 3. Cells which have been sensitized with specific antibody, ricin, colloidal stannic hydroxide, or paraffin oil, are agglutinated whenever the potential is decreased below about 12 millivolts. 4. The agglutination by electrolytes is therefore primarily due to a decrease in the potential whereas agglutination by immune serum, ricin, etc., is due primarily to an increase in the critical potential.",1924,2,22,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Depending on the magnitude of H a p p l , we observe two different types of transitions between the parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) magnetic configurations of the the Co layers. If H a p p l is smaller than some threshold value, the transitions between P and AP are relatively sharp and irreversible. For H a p p l exceeding this threshold value, the transitions are progressive and reversible. We show that this behavior can be precisely accounted for by introducing the current-induced torque of the spin transfer models into a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to determine the stability or instability of the P and AP states. This analysis also provides a good description for the field dependence of the critical currents.",2002,31,172,0,0,6,11,26,22,23,12,6,7,4

The kinetics of rotaxane formation by the slipping procedure were investigated by absorption UV−visible and 1H-NMR spectroscopies in a range of temperatures and solvents, varying systematically the size of both the stoppers and the macrocyclic components. As expected, the rate constants for these processes are affected by the size complementarity between macrocycles and stoppers. Furthermore, the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energies of activation associated with the slippage and the effect of solvent polarity upon the outcome of these processes have been evaluated. In addition, the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of some of the rotaxanes are presented and discussed with reference to the properties of their chrom...",1997,0,104,0,6,7,3,2,3,2,2,7,5,3

 baryon lifetimes","We report measurements of the lifetimes of the $\Lambda_c^+$, $\Xi_c^+$ and $\Xi_c^0$ charm baryons using proton-proton collision data at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8\tev, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment. The charm baryons are reconstructed through the decays $\Lambda_c^+\to pK^-\pi^+$, $\Xi_c^+\to pK^-\pi^+$ and $\Xi_c^0\to pK^-K^-\pi^+$, and originate from semimuonic decays of beauty baryons. The lifetimes are measured relative to that of the $D^+$ meson, and are determined to be \begin{align*} \tau_{\Lambda_c^+} &= 203.5\pm1.0\pm1.3\pm1.4~{\rm fs}, \newline \tau_{\Xi_c^+} &= 456.8\pm3.5\pm2.9\pm3.1~{\rm fs}, \newline \tau_{\Xi_c^0} &= 154.5\pm1.7\pm1.6\pm1.0~{\rm fs}, \end{align*} where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and due to the uncertainty in the $D^+$ lifetime. The measurements are approximately 3--4 times more precise than the current world average values.

With an absorptance sensitivity of < 10{sup {minus}5}, Photothermal Deflection Spectroscopy (PDS) is ideal for determining the absorption coefficients of thin films of transparent'' materials. We have used PDS to measure the optical absorption spectra of the conjugated polymers poly(1,4-phenylene-vinylene) (and derivitives) and polydiacetylene-4BCMU in the spectral region from 0.55 eV to 3 eV. Our spectra show that the shape of the absorption edge varies considerably from polymer to polymer, with polydiacetylene-4BCMU having the steepest absorption edge. The minimum absorption coefficients measured varied somewhat with sample age and quality, but were typically in the range 1 cm{sup {minus}1} to 10 cm{sup {minus}1}. In the region below 1 eV, overtones of C-H stretching modes were observed, indicating that further improvements in transparency in this spectral region might be achieved via deuteration of fluorination. 11 refs., 4 figs.",1991,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No high-resolution structure of the intact ribosome has contained a complete active site including both A- and P-site tRNAs. In addition, although past structures of the 50S subunit have found no ordered proteins at the PTC, biochemical evidence suggests that specific proteins are capable of interacting with the 3′ ends of tRNA ligands. Here we present structures, at 3.6-Å and 3.5-Å resolution respectively, of the 70S ribosome in complex with A- and P-site tRNAs that mimic pre- and post-peptidyl-transfer states. These structures demonstrate that the PTC is very similar between the 50S subunit and the intact ribosome.

Under circumstances of exceptionally severe inanition, the hypertrophy may not occur, the fragment remaining unchanged or even undergoing a slight atrophy. But since in comparable controls the hepatic atrophy is extreme, the duplication in the liver weights still manifests itself. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the liver changes which take place in fasting animal are essentially conditioned on functional demands made upon the organ. Yet great as is the hepatic atrophy then occurring, this does not necessarily mean that these demands are much lessened during inanition. For a comparison of the liver weight with that of the soft body (net body weight less the weight of the ligamentous skeleton) brings out the fact that the organ is, relatively speaking, three-fourths as large at extreme inanition as in the well nourished individual. Of the missing fourth a part may be foodstuffs on temporary deposit. And the rest is perhaps to be accounted for by the existence of special conditions during inanition which favor the vicarious assumption of a part of the usual liver work by the other tissues. While the findings show that the liver size is essentially dependent on functional demands, they do not enable one to say whether the special demands in question come normally to the organ by way of the portal stream.",1924,2,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0

In both cases, a further separation of the two fractions was achieved by DEAE-cellulose column adsorption and elution with a potassium chloride gradient. The prepurified liver fractions were also identified as T 1 and T 2 , respectively, after Sephadex G-200 chromatography. Cross complementation was obtained between T 1 and T 2 derived from either source. A ribosome-linked GTPase partly coincided with the T 2 fraction but did not respond to the addition of template or aminoacyl-sRNA. The T 1 fraction catalyzed GTP-linked binding of aminoacyl-sRNA to template-charged ribosomes, and GTP hydrolysis was observed coincident with the T 1 -linked binding of aminoacyl-sRNA to the ribosome but exceeded the binding reaction about 20-fold. The binding assay was performed in the absence of a sulfhydryl compound to prevent polymerization. The T 2 function was not studied in detail, except that it caused polymerization when added to the T 1 system together with a sulfhydryl compound. A common nomenclature is proposed, and a separation procedure that is generally applicable to mammalian cell extractions is presented.",1968,14,82,0,1,6,11,17,10,11,7,2,3,3

Unique among the prion diseases, it is transmitted among captive and free-ranging animals. To facilitate studies of the biology of CWD prions, we generated five lines of transgenic (Tg) mice expressing prion protein (PrP) from Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), denoted Tg(ElkPrP), and two lines of Tg mice expressing PrP common to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), denoted Tg(DePrP). None of the Tg(ElkPrP) or Tg(DePrP) mice exhibited spontaneous neurologic dysfunction at more than 600 days of age. Brain samples from CWD-positive elk, white-tailed deer, and mule deer produced disease in Tg(ElkPrP) mice between 180 and 200 days after inoculation and in Tg(DePrP) mice between 300 and 400 days. One of eight cervid brain inocula transmitted disease to Tg(MoPrP)4053 mice overexpressing wild-type mouse PrP-A in ∼540 days. Neuropathologic analysis revealed abundant PrP amyloid plaques in the brains of ill mice. Brain homogenates from symptomatic Tg(ElkPrP) mice produced disease in 120 to 190 days in Tg(ElkPrP) mice. In contrast to the Tg(ElkPrP) and Tg(DePrP) mice, Tg mice overexpressing human, bovine, or ovine PrP did not develop prion disease after inoculation with CWD prions from among nine different isolates after >500 days. These findings suggest that CWD prions from elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer can be readily transmitted among these three cervid species.",2006,62,170,15,1,10,15,10,13,14,12,13,13,12

Fields and chemical potential gradients are induced by a transport current which causes the vortex to move with velocity ${\stackrel{\ensuremath{\rightarrow}}{\mathrm{v}}}_{L}$. These are determined self-consistently by the requirement that they generate a supercurrent to correspond to the displacement of a static vortex and compensate for scattering of thermally excited quasiparticles. Making use of an approximate analytic solution for a static vortex by Kramer and Pesch, it is shown that for the case of pure ($l\ensuremath{\gg}{\ensuremath{\xi}}_{0}$) superconductors at low temperatures ($T\ensuremath{\lesssim}0.5{T}_{c}$) there is no backflow. The component of ${\stackrel{\ensuremath{\rightarrow}}{\mathrm{v}}}_{L}$ in the direction of the transport current is the transport velocity, a result of the Hall effect on the bound states in the vortex core.",1975,0,20,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,1,0,0,0

To learn how C. elegans Dicer, DCR-1, functions in multiple distinct silencing mechanisms, we used a mass-spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify DCR-1-interacting proteins. We then generated and characterized deletion alleles for the corresponding genes. The interactors are required for production of three species of small RNA, including (1) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), derived from exogenous dsRNA triggers (exo-siRNAs); (2) siRNAs derived from endogenous triggers (endo-siRNAs); and (3) developmental regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs). One interactor, the conserved RNA-phosphatase homolog PIR-1, is required for the processing of a putative amplified DCR-1 substrate. Interactors required for endo-siRNA production include ERI-1 and RRF-3, whose loss of function enhances RNAi. Our findings provide a first glimpse at the complex biochemical niche of Dicer and suggest that competition exists between DCR-1-mediated small-RNA pathways.",2006,53,380,42,22,27,32,21,37,26,32,40,29,11

We have found that presynaptic inhibition can be elicited in conditions in which the Na+ and the various K+ channels are pharmacologically blocked and depolarizing current pulses produce only an inward Ca2+ current. Both inward currents and tail currents at and above the K+ reversal potential were always less inward during presynaptic inhibition. The changes in conductance associated with presynaptic inhibition were voltage sensitive and paralleled the voltage sensitivity of the Ca2+ channel. We therefore conclude that presynaptic inhibition is caused by a direct transmitter-mediated decreased of presynaptic Ca2+-channel conductance.",1980,0,75,0,3,9,7,8,6,4,7,2,3,2

Ribozymes with four different activities were selected based on covalent bond formation to a substrate RNA. The first activity was reversible self‐cleavage; ribozymes self‐cleaved then ligated the 5′‐hydroxyl group of the substrate oligonucleotide to their 2′,3′‐cyclic phosphate intermediate. The second activity was 2′,5′‐branch formation by the attack of a substrate 2′‐hydroxyl group on the 5′‐terminal triphosphate of the ribozyme transcript, releasing pyrophosphate. The third ribozyme activity was similar to reversible self‐cleavage but was a three‐step reaction. This ribozyme self‐cleaved, then cleaved the substrate in trans, and then ligated the substrate 3′ cleavage product to its cyclic phosphate intermediate. This three‐step pathway shares similarities with the pathway of tRNA splicing. The fourth activity was 2′,3′‐branch formation; to form this unusual branch, a 2′‐hydroxyl of the substrate attacked an internal phosphate of the ribozyme, releasing an oligonucleotide leaving group. The isolation of branching activities by the in vitro selection protocol was unanticipated and was due to surprising properties of reverse transcriptase, which can read through 2′,5′‐ or 2′,3′‐branches and efficiently perform non‐templated intramolecular jumps.",1998,69,50,2,0,9,3,6,4,0,1,2,1,3

In contrast to previous chopped light transmission measurements of these effects, the PDS technique can directly measure the buildup or decay of the absorption coefficient, {alpha}, on the time scale of second to days. In the case of MEHPPV we observe that the time scale of seconds to days. In the case of MEHPPV we observe that above-gap light causes the appearance of a broad infrared peak in {alpha}, which continues to grow-in hours after the pump light is first applied. For this polymer the general shape of the absorption spectra in the unpumped state mimics the photo-induced changes, suggesting that remnant photo-induced states determine the maximum transparency observed under normal experimental conditions. For P3HT and to a lesser extent, MEHPPV, we also observe irreversible photo-induced absorption components which we tentatively identify with photo-induced oxidation of the polymer matrix. 10 refs., 8 figs.",1991,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
a97abd76ed33d91c48f60ec720ae4425a1146ca4,Effects of acetaldehyde on hepatocyte glycerol uptake and cell size: implication of aquaporin 9.,"BACKGROUND
The effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde on uptake of glycerol and on cell size of hepatocytes and a role Aquaporin 9 (AQP9), a glycerol transport channel, were evaluated.


METHODS
The studies were done in primary rat and mouse hepatocytes. The uptake of [(14) C] glycerol was determined with hepatocytes in suspension. For determination of cell size, rat hepatocytes on coated dishes were incubated with a lipophilic fluorochrome that is incorporated into the cell membrane and examined by confocal microscopy. A three-dimensional z scan of the cell was performed, and the middle slice of the z scan was used for area measurements.


RESULTS
Acute exposure to acetaldehyde, but not to ethanol, causes a rapid increase in the uptake of glycerol and an increase in hepatocyte size, which was inhibited by HgCl(2) , an inhibitor of aquaporins. This was not observed in hepatocytes from AQP9 knockout mice, nor observed by direct application of acetaldehyde to AQP9 expressed in Xenopus Laevis oocytes. Prolonged 24-hour exposure to either acetaldehyde or ethanol did not result in an increase in glycerol uptake by rat hepatocytes. Acetaldehyde decreased AQP9 mRNA and AQP9 protein, while ethanol decreased AQP9 mRNA but not AQP9 protein. Ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, increased the activities of glycerol kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.


CONCLUSIONS
The acute effects of acetaldehyde, while mediated by AQP9, are probably influenced by binding of acetaldehyde to hepatocyte membranes and changes in cell permeability. The effects of ethanol in enhancing glucose kinase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase leading to increased formation of glycerol-3-phosphate most likely contribute to alcoholic fatty liver.",2011,27,12,0,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,1,0,1

Here we demonstrate that the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus segregates its chromosome using a partitioning (Par) apparatus that has surprising similarities to eukaryotic spindles. We show that the C. crescentus ATPase ParA forms linear polymers in vitro and assembles into a narrow linear structure in vivo. The centromere-binding protein ParB binds to and destabilizes ParA structures in vitro. We propose that this ParB-stimulated ParA depolymerization activity moves the centromere to the opposite cell pole through a burnt bridge Brownian ratchet mechanism. Finally, we identify the pole-specific TipN protein as a new component of the Par system that is required to maintain the directionality of DNA transfer towards the new cell pole. Our results elucidate a bacterial chromosome segregation mechanism that features basic operating principles similar to eukaryotic mitotic machines, including a multivalent protein complex at the centromere that stimulates the dynamic disassembly of polymers to move chromosomes into daughter compartments.",2010,41,322,32,3,33,42,39,49,29,21,30,24,20

The two populations clearly differed in phenotype; anti-Ig blasts were FcR+, B220+, 33D1-, while dendritic cells were FcR-, B220-, 33D1+. However, as MLR stimulators, they shared many common features. Both cells (a) expressed comparable levels of class II MHC products; (b) independently stimulated the primary MLR and the production of several T derived lymphokines including IL-2 and IL-4; and (c) were comparable in stimulating freshly sensitized T cells. However, the relative potencies of dendritic cells and anti-Ig blasts as primary MLR stimulators varied in a strain-dependent fashion. Only anti-Ig blasts could stimulate across an Mls barrier, being at least 100 times more active in stimulating Mls-mismatched, MHC-matched T cells, relative to syngeneic T cells. In contrast, dendritic cells were 10-30 times more potent than anti-Ig blasts when stimulating across an MHC barrier and were likewise more effective in binding MHC-disparate T cells to form the clusters in which the MLR was generated. Dendritic cell-T cell clustering was resistant to anti-LFA-1 mAb, while B blast-T cell clustering was totally blocked. Thus, anti-Ig B lymphoblasts and dendritic cells, two cell types which differ markedly in phenotype, also differ in efficiency and mechanism for initiating responses in allogeneic T cells.",1989,43,95,4,4,7,6,7,5,3,3,8,6,6

In an attempt to raise monoclonal antibodies against the NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli we encountered difficulties in the screening procedure, which is based on the standard enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Here we report a rapid and efficient method of screening for anti‐NhaA mAbs which recognize native epitopes of the antiporter. The method is based on the use of His‐tagged protein, Ni2+‐nitrilotriacetic acid coated plates and non‐denaturing conditions in the assay. With this procedure four mAbs were obtained, three of which recognize the NhaA in its native conformation and one preferentially recognizes the denatured form. The latter mAb is Western blot positive, the others are Western blot negative and bind the detergent solubilized NhaA as assayed by gel filtration chromatography. Competition experiments show that the native epitopes are common to both the His‐tagged and the wild‐type protein. We suggest that in the standard ELISA the NhaA protein is not presented to the antibody in the native conformation whereas the His tag based protocol favors this presentation. Indeed, we could remarkably improve the low reactivity of the standard ELISA by coating the plates with anti‐NhaA mAb and use it to present NhaA (‘sandwich' ELISA or two antibodies assay). Remarkably, two of the mAbs (5H4, 2C5) which bind native NhaA inhibit drastically the ΔpH driven 22Na uptake mediated by His‐tagged NhaA reconstituted in proteoliposomes. Hence, these mAbs afford a new tool to study the structure/function relationship of the antiporter.",1998,29,42,1,0,1,1,3,3,5,3,2,2,2

7265f25d77feb500f7e5e6f7ad7c5a27285c22ec,Structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HO gene and analysis of its upstream regulatory region.,"The HO gene product of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a site-specific endonuclease that initiates mating type interconversion. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 3,129-base-pair (bp) segment containing HO. The segment contains a single long open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 586 amino acids, which has unusual (unbiased) codon usage and is preceded by 762 bp of upstream region. The predicted HO protein is basic (16% lysine and arginine) and is calculated to have a secondary structure that is 30% helical. The corresponding transcript is initiated approximately 50 nucleotides prior to the presumed initiation codon. Insertion of an Escherichia coli lacZ gene fragment into the putative HO coding segment inactivated HO and formed a hybrid HO-lacZ gene whose beta-galactosidase activity was regulated by the mating type locus in the same manner as HO (repressed by a 1-alpha 2). Upstream regions of 1,360 and 762 bp conferred strong repression; 436 bp led to partial constitutivity and 301 bp to full constitutivity. Thus, DNA sequences that confer repression of HO by a1-alpha 2 are at least 250 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start point and are within 436 nucleotides of the HO initiation codon. The progressive loss of repression suggests that both the -762 to -436 and the -436 to -301 intervals contain sites for regulation by a1-alpha 2. The HO gene contains two distinct regions that promote autonomous replication of plasmids in S. cerevisiae. These regions contain sequences that are homologous to the two conserved sequences that are associated with ARS activity.",1986,0,126,8,0,6,3,4,10,7,7,5,5,8

A G-substrate cDNA was identified by screening expressed sequence tag databases from a human brain library. The deduced amino acid sequence of human G-substrate contained two putative phosphorylation sites (Thr-68 and Thr-119) with amino acid sequences [KPRRKDT(p)PALH] that were identical to those reported for rabbit G-substrate. G-substrate mRNA was expressed almost exclusively in the cerebellum as a single transcript. The human G-substrate gene was mapped to human chromosome 7p15 by radiation hybrid panel analysis. In vitro translation products of the cDNA showed an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa on SDS/PAGE which was close to that of purified rabbit G-substrate (23 kDa). Bacterially expressed human G-substrate is a heat-stable and acid-soluble protein that cross-reacts with antibodies raised against rabbit G-substrate. Recombinant human G-substrate was phosphorylated efficiently by cGMP-dependent protein kinase exclusively at Thr residues, and it was recognized by antibodies specific for rabbit phospho-G-substrate. The amino acid sequences surrounding the sites of phosphorylation in G-substrate are related to those around Thr-34 and Thr-35 of the dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein DARPP-32 and inhibitor-1, respectively, two potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase 1. However, purified G-substrate phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibited protein phosphatase 2A more effectively than protein phosphatase 1, suggesting a distinct role as a protein phosphatase inhibitor.",1999,51,77,4,1,5,5,4,8,7,7,3,5,5

To determine the correlation between adrenal steroids and medullary function, maternal blood was collected during pregnancy, first stage of labor (MVI) and at delivery (MVII). Umbilical arterial and venous blood (UA, UV) was also obtained at delivery. Further, ACTH or dexamethasone (Dx) was given during the first stage of labor, and maternal blood was collected before and 30 minutes after the administration. Plasma levels of CA[noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (Ad)] were extracted by trihydroxyindole method and were measured by HPLC. DHA-S and F levels were determined by specific RIA. Results are as follows: 1. No apparent change was observed in maternal NA and Ad levels throughout pregnancy. DHA-S levels were high in first trimester and decreased as pregnancy advanced, while F levels showed an increase trend as pregnancy progressed. 2. All hormone levels in maternal blood increased remarkably during labor. A significant negative correlation between F and Ad levels at delivery was noted. When F levels were elevated by ACTH administration, Ad levels decreased. Ad levels elevated when F levels were suppressed by Dx administration. 3. NA, Ad and DHA-S levels in cord blood were higher than those in MVII. Levels of F in maternal blood were higher than those in cord blood. A significant correlation of F in MVII and UA was observed. These results indicate that the suppressive effect of F may be involved in the mechanism of Ad secretion, though the secretion of Ad increased with F in the course of labor.

S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine or (Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-aminoethyl)-amino]-diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate inhibited RASMC growth at concentrations as low as 3 μM, and DFMO elicited effects at concentrations of 100 μM or greater. The cytostatic effect of NO and DFMO was prevented by the MAPK kinase 1/2 inhibitors PD 098,059 or U0126. This finding suggests that the p42/p44 MAPK pathway is involved in the inhibition of RASMC proliferation by NO. Western blot analysis revealed that treatment of RASMC with NO or DFMO leads to activation of p42/p44 MAPK and induction of p21waf1/cip1. This effect was prevented by MAPK kinase 1/2 inhibitors, suggesting that induction of p21waf1/cip1 depended on activation of p42/p44. Moreover, activation of p42/p44 and induction of p21waf1/cip1 were prevented by exogenous putrescine but not ornithine, suggesting this effect was due to the inhibition of ODC by NO or DFMO. Finally, activation of p42/p44 MAPK and induction of p21waf1/cip1 were cGMP-independent. Neither 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo[4,3-α]quinoxalin-1-one nor zaprinast influenced the cytostatic effect of NO or DFMO or their ability to activate these signal transduction pathways. These observations suggest that inhibition of ODC and accompanying putrescine production are the underlying mechanisms by which NO and DFMO activate the MAPK pathway to promote induction of p21waf1/cip1 and consequent inhibition of cell proliferation.",2001,30,68,1,0,5,6,7,8,10,9,4,2,2

Here we analyze the actions of telomerase from Tetrahymena thermophila assembled in vivo with mutated or wild-type telomerase RNA to define further the roles of particular telomerase RNA residues involved in essential enzymatic functions: templating, substrate alignment, and promotion of polymerization. Position 49 of the telomerase RNA defined the 3' templating residue boundary, demonstrating that seven positions, residues 43 to 49, are capable of acting as templating residues. We demonstrate directly that positioning of the primer substrate involves Watson-Crick base pairing between the primer with telomerase RNA residues. Unexpectedly, formation of a Watson-Crick base pair specifically between the primer DNA and telomerase RNA residue 50 is critical in promoting primer elongation. In contrast, mutant telomerase with the cytosine at position 49 mutated to a G exhibited efficient 3' mispair extension. This work provides new evidence for specific primer-telomerase interactions, as well as base-specific interactions involving the telomerase RNA, playing roles in essential active-site functions of telomerase.",1996,35,81,2,3,8,11,4,13,2,7,6,6,3

We have developed a mouse model that mimics these features of CGL: the syndrome occurs in transgenic mice expressing a truncated version of a nuclear protein known as nSREBP-1c (for sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c) under the control of the adipose-specific aP2 enhancer. Adipose tissue from these mice was markedly deficient in messenger RNAs encoding several fat-specific proteins, including leptin, a fat-derived hormone that regulates food intake and energy metabolism. Here we show that insulin resistance in our lipodystrophic mice can be overcome by a continuous systemic infusion of low doses of recombinant leptin, an effect that is not mimicked by chronic food restriction. Our results support the idea that leptin modulates insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal independently of its effect on food intake, and that leptin deficiency accounts for the insulin resistance found in CGL.",1999,15,982,21,1,45,58,74,65,71,63,58,43,41
1f79b55b6eb43b205d4144080a8393ed1cb9173e,The adrenal dopamine as an indicator of adrenomedullary hormone biosynthesis,"SummaryOne pair of rat adrenals was found to contain 100–200 ng of dopamine (DA), the molar concentration ratio of DA to adrenaline + noradrenaline being about 0.005. After inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase DA decreased exponentially, with a half life of 1.35 h. Insulin and the ganglionic blocking agent chlorisondamine caused within 90 min an increase in adrenal DA which was prevented by a high spinal transection. Chlorisondamine prevented the insulin-induced depletion of adrenaline but the rise in DA persisted. The insulin-induced increase in DA was enhanced by inhibitors of dopamine-β-hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase.The data support the view that neurogenic stimulation of the adrenal medulla activates the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase by a mechanism which can be dissociated from the secretory response. Therefore, reduced end-product inhibition does not seem to be a likely explanation of the increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity. The observations suggest that neurogenic short-term activation of tyrosine hydroxylase, like the long-term induction of this enzyme is mediated by special receptors, which can be distinguished from the nicotinic receptors mediating the secretory response.",2004,22,29,0,8,6,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1

To test this hypothesis, we have compared plasma lipoproteins in mice that are homozygous for targeted disruptions of the genes for apoE [apoE(-/-)], the LDLR [LDLR(-/-)], and both molecules [poE(-/-); LDLR(-/-)]. On a normal chow diet, apoE(-/-) mice had higher mean plasma cholesterol levels than LDLR(-/-) mice (579 vs. 268 mg/dl). Cholesterol levels in the apoE(-/-); LDLR(-/-) mice were not significantly different from those in the apoE(-/-) mice. LDLR(-/-) mice had a relatively isolated elevation in plasma LDL, whereas apoE(-/-) mice had a marked increase in larger lipoproteins corresponding to very low density lipoproteins and chylomicron remnants. The lipoprotein pattern in apoE(-/-); LDLR(-/-) mice resembled that of apoE(-/-) mice. The LDLR(-/-) mice had a marked elevation in apoB-100 and a modest increase in apoB-48. In contrast, the apoE(-/-) mice had a marked elevation in apoB-48 but not in apoB-100. The LDLR(-/-); apoE(-/-) double homozygotes had marked elevations of both apolipoproteins. The observation that apoB-48 increases more dramatically with apoE deficiency than with LDLR deficiency supports the notion that apoE binds to a second receptor in addition to the LDLR. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that superimposition of a LDLR deficiency onto an apoE deficiency [apoE(-/-); LDLR(-/-) double homozygotes] does not increase hypercholesterolemia beyond the level observed with apoE deficiency alone.",1994,0,440,18,0,11,11,15,20,23,18,19,11,14
58012273b4a12fbb3a614386b02abf56fceb3f43,A cellular mechanism of classical conditioning in Aplysia: activity-dependent amplification of presynaptic facilitation.,"A training procedure analogous to differential classical conditioning produces differential facilitation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP's) in the neuronal circuit for the siphon withdrawal reflex in Aplysia. Thus, tail shock (the unconditioned stimulus) produces greater facilitation of the monosynaptic EPSP from a siphon sensory neuron to a siphon motor neuron if the shock is preceded by spike activity in the sensory neuron than if the shock and spike activity occur in a specifically unpaired pattern or if the shock occurs alone. Further experiments indicate that this activity-dependent amplification of facilitation is presynaptic in origin and involves a differential increase in spike duration and thus in Ca2+ influx in paired versus unpaired sensory neurons. The results of these cellular experiments are quantitatively similar to the results of behavioral experiments with the same protocol and parameters, suggesting that activity-dependent amplification of presynaptic facilitation may make a significant contribution to classical conditioning of the withdrawal reflex.",1983,30,596,24,9,45,22,28,50,22,21,12,20,8

We attempted to restore scrapie infectivity after exposure to protein denaturants including urea, chaotropic salts, and SDS. None of the procedures restored infectivity. Dialysis to remove slowly chaotropic ions and urea failed to restore scrapie infectivity. Attempts to create monomers of the scrapie isoform of the prion protein under nondenaturing conditions using a wide variety of detergents have been unsuccessful, to date, except for one report claiming that scrapie infectivity could be recovered from 12% polyacrylamide gels after SDS/PAGE [Brown, P., Liberski, P. P., Wolff, A. & Gajdusek, D. C. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 7240-7244]. We found that < 0.001% of the infectious prion titer could be recovered from the region of a polyacrylamide gel where the denatured proteinase K-resistant core of the scrapie isoform of the prion protein and other 30-kDa proteins migrate.

We previously cloned a novel member of the voltage-gated K channel family from mouse brain (mBCNG-1) that contained a carboxy-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (Santoro et al., 1997) and hence proposed it to be a candidate gene for pacemaker channels. Heterologous expression of mBCNG-1 demonstrates that it does indeed code for a channel with properties indistinguishable from pacemaker channels in brain and similar to those in heart. Three additional mouse genes and two human genes closely related to mBCNG-1 display unique patterns of mRNA expression in different tissues, including brain and heart, demonstrating that these channels constitute a widely expressed gene family.",1998,95,685,48,11,36,37,46,31,50,41,32,34,36

Surprisingly, this decarboxylation reaction is carried out as an FMN-dependent redox reaction. In the first half-reaction, the side-chain of the cysteine residue of 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine is oxidised and the thioaldehyde intermediate decarboxylates spontaneously to the 4'-phosphopantothenoyl-aminoethenethiol intermediate. In the second half-reaction this compound is reduced to 4'-phosphopantetheine and the FMNH(2) cofactor is re-oxidised. The active site mutant C175S is unable to perform this reductive half-reaction. Here, we present the crystal structure of the AtHAL3a mutant C175S in complex with the reaction intermediate pantothenoyl-aminoethenethiol and FMNH(2). The geometry of binding suggests that reduction of the C(alpha)=C(beta) double bond of the intermediate can be performed by direct hydride-transfer from N5 of FMNH(2) to C(beta) of the aminoethenethiol-moiety supported by a protonation of C(alpha) by Cys175. The binding mode of the substrate is very similar to that previously observed for a pentapeptide to the homologous enzyme EpiD that introduces the aminoethenethiol-moiety as final reaction product at the C terminus of peptidyl-cysteine residues. This finding further supports our view that these homologous enzymes form a protein family of homo-oligomeric flavin-containing cysteine decarboxylases, which we have termed HFCD family.",2003,29,49,2,4,7,4,4,0,0,3,4,2,2

Here, we show that the lipid‐kinase activity of Vps34 is required for autophagy, implying an essential role of its product PtdIns(3)P. The protein‐kinase activity of Vps15, a regulatory subunit of the PtdIns 3‐kinase complex, is also required for efficient autophagy. We monitored the distribution of PtdIns(3)P in living cells using a specific indicator, the 2xFYVE domain derived from mammalian Hrs. PtdIns(3)P was abundant at endosomes and on the vacuolar membrane during logarithmic growth phase. Under starvation conditions, we observed massive transport of PtdIns(3)P into the vacuole. This accumulation was dependent on the membrane dynamics of autophagy. Notably, PtdIns(3)P was highly enriched and delivered into the vacuole as a component of autophagosome membranes but not as a cargo enclosed within them, implying direct involvement of this phosphoinositide in autophagosome formation. We also found a possible enrichment of PtdIns(3)P on the inner autophagosomal membrane compared to the outer membrane. Based on these results we discuss the function of PtdIns(3)P in autophagy.",2008,52,149,7,8,10,15,16,16,15,9,4,12,12

This study investigated hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) capsids and RNA phage Qbeta coats as carriers of a foreign epitope to induce antibody responses in mice. HBcAg capsids were shown to induce T cell-independent (TI) antibodies. We found that these particles behave as antigen-specific TI type 1 (TI-1) Ag comparable to other rigidly structured viruses. When a 5-aa long epitope of the pre-S1 domain of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was introduced into the optimal position of the HBc molecule, it also behaved as a TI-1 Ag. Best efficiency of the antibody response to the foreign epitope was achieved by a compensatory deletion after the epitope to retain the regular structure of the HBcAg capsid with a highly repetitive superficial exposition of the foreign epitope. For recombinant Qbeta phage coats, a much more efficient antibody response to the foreign epitope was achieved when the foreign epitope was expressed repetitively on a particulate derivate of Qbeta phage coats. Thus, recombinant virus particles are suitable vaccine carriers for the introduction of foreign B cell epitopes, if precise structural requirements are fulfilled.",1998,35,168,0,0,6,4,5,7,7,5,10,10,11

Downstream effectors of this response, however, are not well characterized. Data reported here eliminated Cdc25A degradation and inhibition of Cdk2-cyclin E as intrinsic components of the UVC-induced pathway of inhibition of replicon initiation in human cells. A sublethal dose of UVC (1 J/m2), which selectively inhibits replicon initiation by 50%, failed to reduce the amount of Cdc25A protein or decrease Cdk2-cyclin E kinase activity. Cdc25A degradation was observed after irradiation with cytotoxic fluences of UVC, suggesting that severe inhibition of DNA chain elongation and activation of the replication checkpoint might be responsible for the UVC-induced degradation of Cdc25A. Another proposed effector of the S checkpoint is the Cdc7-Dbf4 complex. Dbf4 interacted weakly with Chk1 in vivo but was recognized as a substrate for Chk1-dependent phosphorylation in vitro. FLAG-Dbf4 formed complexes with endogenous Cdc7, and this interaction was stable in UVC-irradiated HeLa cells. Overexpression of FLAG- or Myc-tagged Dbf4 abrogated the S checkpoint response to UVC but not ionizing radiation. These findings implicate a Dbf4-dependent kinase as a possible target of the ATR- and Chk1-dependent S checkpoint response to UVC.",2007,82,79,6,3,9,5,8,3,8,12,4,2,6

Nitric oxide (NO), an endogenous free radical, is a product of macrophages that mediates inflammatory and cytotoxic processes in the immune system. Here we report the effects of NO on MAP kinase signaling and NF-kappaB activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages and correlate these effects to the induction target genes, including interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and IkappaB-alpha. LPS alone induced a rapid phosphorylation of the stress-activated MAP kinases: c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. Simultaneous treatment with LPS and the NO donor, diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO), enhanced and prolonged JNK and p38 phosphorylation. Similarly, DEA/NO prolonged the LPS-induced degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitory subunit, IkappaB-alpha, despite an increase in IkappaB-alpha mRNA levels. Whereas DEA/NO alone was sufficient to induce JNK and p38 phosphorylation, it was not sufficient to cause IkappaB-alpha degradation. The enhancement of IkappaB-alpha degradation by DEA/NO correlated with an increase in the nuclear levels of the p50 and p65 subunits and DNA-binding activity determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. DEA/NO and an additional NO donor, MAHMA/NO, are further demonstrated to enhance the transcriptional expression of the IFN-beta gene.

While when the layer is thicker than h c , many cracks and V-shaped grooves appear in the Al x Ga 1- x N and GaN layers, and their densities increase with increasing x . The mechanism of the cracking is the relaxation of the strain energy due to the lattice misfit between Al x Ga 1-x N and GaN during the growth, but not due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between Al x Ga 1-x N and GaN during the cooling after the growth. For the preparation of the Al x Ga 1-x N/GaN HS with a smooth surface free from cracks, it is important to control the thickness and the composition of the Al x Ga 1-x N layer.",1990,10,74,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,3,7

K01-0509. The property has been traced to the novel guadinomines A to D, and three of them have been identified as being selective inhibitors of T3SS. In the process of isolation, a new compound, guadinomic acid was detected, occurring as a biosynthetic intermediate. The T3SS is expressed by many Gram-negative pathogens, where it helps deliver effector proteins into the host cell during the infection process.Original structural analysis was elucidated by spectroscopic studies including various NMR experiments.

Their effect on postsynaptic inhibition is less clear, although the available evidence suggests that a similar enhancement may occur at some sites5–7. Since the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (i.p.s.p.s) in hippocampal neurones are unusually large and the neurones are readily penetrable by microelectrodes8, we have studied the effect of barbiturates on these i.p.s.p.s in detail. We have found that barbiturates hyperpolarise hippocampal neurones and markedly prolong the i.p.s.p. by a direct action on inhibitory synapses, anaesthetic doses increasing the duration fivefold. The hyperpolarising action of barbiturates and their effect on i.p.s.p.s would both contribute to the neural depressant action of these anaesthetic agents.",1975,21,352,4,0,7,17,22,20,17,28,11,10,16

The construction of artificial motors by chemical synthesis, which can power motions that lead to macroscopic detectable effects in a system, is a major endeavor in contemporary science. To move toward this goal, a host–guest system, composed of a nematic liquid crystal film doped with a chiral light-driven molecular motor, is assembled. Irradiation of the film results in unidirectional rotary motion of the molecular motor, which induces a motion of the mesogenic molecules leading to a molecular reorganization and, as a consequence, a change in the color of the film. In this way, by control of the rotary motion at the molecular level, color tuning over the entire visible spectrum is achieved. These findings demonstrate that a molecular motor can exert a visually observable macroscopic change in a material.",2002,24,85,0,1,2,2,7,5,4,5,4,3,1

The critical volume fraction (fc) of PANI-CSA phase segregated in PMMA is fc ∼ 0.003 (0.3%). The conductivity at room temperature near the percolation threshold is quite high, 3 × 10−3 S/cm. The systematic increase in the exponent of the temperature dependence of conductivity (γ) results from transport on the fractal structure and to the related superlocalization of the electronic wavefunctions with systematic variations in the fractal dimensionality upon dilution of the PANI-CSA. Below the percolation threshold, the temperature dependence of the resistivity is like that of granular metals with γ = 0.5. The positive magnetoresistance (MR) shows a maximum upon decreasing the volume fraction of PANI-CSA in agreement with effective medium theory. Analysis of the MR indicates that the localization length near the percolation threshold is approximately 25 A at 4.2 K.",1995,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Oxygen molecules dissociatively adsorb to occupy quasi-threefold hollow site, long bridge site and atop site on a clean Mo(1 1 2) at 100 K. After annealing this surface to 300 K, a loss peak corresponding to the oxygen atoms at atop sites disappears, changing the adsorption sites into quasi-threefold and long bridge sites. Further annealing to 600 K resulted in the change of the location of oxygen atoms from long bridge site to quasi-threefold hollow site, where the surface shows p(1×2) LEED subspots, indicating that the oxygen atoms in the Mo(1 1 2)–p(1×2)-O surface occupy quasi-threefold hollow sites. Oxygen adsorption on the Mo(1 1 2)–p(1×2)-O surface was also investigated and it was found that oxygen molecules associatively adsorb on the surface to give bridged peroxo species, which dissociates at 200 K to yield oxygen atoms at atop sites. The atop oxygen atoms remain on the surface after annealing to higher temperatures in contrast to the adsorption on clean Mo(1 1 2).

The total Mg concentration varies from 1×1019 to 1×1020 cm−3. Both PL and CL spectra change the initial shape within a few minutes exposure to the excitation source. The effect is permanent at low temperatures but the emission spectrum can be recovered to its initial shape after heating to room temperature. The difference in PL and CL spectra is explained by activation of different regions in the sample by laser and electrons, respectively. In CL the increase of the defect-related luminescence seems to be connected with an enhanced structural defect reaction under electron irradiation, which competes with the regular radiative recombination, while in PL the main effect is related to dissociation of Mg–H complexes with consequent passivation of the residual shallow acceptors.",2007,10,5,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Resonance identification and spin density distribution in the heme group.,"This paper describes the identification of some of the contact-shifted resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum of low spin ferric cytochrome b5. In these experiments comparison with cytochrome b5 which had been reconstituted with deuteroheme IX played an important role. NMR techniques used include double resonance experiments, line width analyses, and studies of the pH-dependence of the 1H NMR chemical shifts. The electronic heme structure derived from these resonance assignments is characterized by a highly anisotropic spin density distribution. This anisotropy is most strikingly manifested in the resonances of the vinyl and propionic acid substituents of the protoheme IX. The experiments described in this paper further revealed the coexistence in aqueous solutions of two different molecular species of cytochrome b5, which can be simultaneously observed in the regions of the 1H NMR spectrum which contain the largely contact-shifted resonances.",1976,21,42,0,2,3,2,2,4,0,3,1,1,2

Here, the challenge has been to move to careful ab initio QM/MM (QM(ai)/MM) free-energy calculations, where obtaining converging results is very demanding and computationally expensive. This work describes such calculations, focusing on the free-energy surface for the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters, paying special attention to the comparison between the one water (1W) and two water (2W) paths for the proton-transfer (PT) step. This issue has been explored before by energy minimization with implicit solvent models and by nonsystematic QM/MM energy minimization, as well as by nonsystematic free-energy mapping. However, no study has provided the needed reliable 2D (3D) surfaces that are necessary for reaching concrete conclusions. Here we report a systematic evaluation of the 2D (3D) free-energy maps for several relevant systems, comparing the results of QM(ai)/MM and QM(ai)/implicit solvent surfaces, and provide an advanced description of the relevant energetics. It is found that the 1W path for the hydrolysis of the methyl diphosphate (MDP) trianion is 6-9 kcal/mol higher than that the 2W path. This difference becomes slightly larger in the presence of the Mg(2+) ion because this ion reduces the pKa of the conjugated acid form of the phosphate oxygen that accepts the proton. Interestingly, the BLYP approach (which has been used extensively in some studies) gives a much smaller difference between the 1W and 2W activation barriers. At any rate, it is worth pointing out that the 2W transition state for the PT is not much higher that the common plateau that serves as the starting point of both the 1W and 2W PT paths. Thus, the calculated catalytic effects of proteins based on the 2W PT mechanistic model are not expected to be different from the catalytic effects predicted using the 1W PT mechanistic model, which was calibrated on the observed barrier in solution and in which the TS charge distribution was similar to the that of the plateau (as was done in all of our previous EVB studies).",2013,46,44,0,1,10,6,8,6,6,4,3,0,0

Tripeptides (pyro)Glu-3Me-His-Gly-OH, (pyro)Glu-His-D-Ala-OH, D-(pyro)Glu-His-Gly-OH, (pyro)Glu-His-Trp-NH2, (pyro)Glu-His-Gly-NH2, and (pyro)Glu-His-Gly-ethylamide, but not control peptides Glu-His-Pro-OH or Leu-Arg-Phe-OH, significantly suppressed the cephalic phase rise in serum insulin and gastrin as compared to saline-infused controls and lowered these hormonal levels below basal values. Analogs (pyro)Glu-3Me-His-Gly-OH, D-(pyro)Glu-His-Gly-OH, and (pyro)Glu-His-D-Ala-OH also significantly inhibited the gastric acid response to sham feeding. The reductions in gastric acid caused by (pyro)Glu-His-Gly-NH2 or (pyro)Glu-His-Gly-ethylamide were less intense. Statistical analyses of food intake in 86 sham feeding experiments in seven dogs showed that the reduction during the infusion of (pyro)Glu-His-Gly-OH and its analogs was not significant by Duncan's multiple range test, and only that induced in (pyro)Glu-3Me-His-Gly-OH was significant by Student's t-test as compared to saline control.

Telomere shortening is associated with diseases of ageing in mammals.

We developed an experimental model to examine the impacts of extended unpredictable stress on telomerase activity in male rats.

1c20a3d761465028315950034b1c07ebe3aa638c,A mechanically interlocked bundle.,"The prototype of an artificial molecular machine consisting of a trisammonium tricationic component interlocked with a tris(crown ether) component to form a molecular bundle with averaged C(3v) symmetry has been designed and synthesized. The system is based on noncovalent interactions, which include 1) N(+)-H...O hydrogen bonds; 2) C-H...O interactions between the CH(2)NH(2) (+)CH(2) protons on three dibenzylammonium-ion-containing arms, which are attached symmetrically to a benzenoid core, and three dibenzo[24]crown-8 macrorings fused onto a triphenylene core; and 3) pi...pi stacking interactions between the aromatic cores. The template-directed synthesis of the mechanically interlocked, triply threaded bundle involves post-assembly covalent modification, that is, the efficient conversion of three azide functions at the ends of the arms of the bound and threaded trication into bulky triazole stoppers, after 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with di-tert-butylacetylenedicarboxylate to the extremely strong 1:1 adduct that is formed in dichloromethane/acetonitrile (3:2), on account of a cluster effect associated with the paucivalent adduct. Evidence for the averaged C(3v) symmetry of the molecular bundle comes from absorption and luminescence data, as well as from electrochemical experiments, (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The photophysical properties of the mechanically interlocked bundle are very similar to those of the superbundle that precedes the formation of the bundle in the process of supramolecular assistance to covalent synthesis. Although weak non-nucleophilic bases (e.g., nBu(3)N and iPr(2)NEt) fail to deprotonate the bundle, the strong tBuOK does, as indicated by both luminescence and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. While deprotonation undoubtedly loosens up the interlocked structure of the molecular bundle by replacing relatively strong N(+)-H...O hydrogen bonds by much weaker N-H...O ones, the pi...pi stacking interactions ensure that any structural changes are inconsequential, particularly when the temperature of the solution of the neutral molecular bundle in dichloromethane is cooled down to considerably below room temperature.",2004,2,64,0,3,3,8,4,7,6,4,4,4,1

Stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor results in a 30-fold increase in the activity of N-acetyltransferase (= arylamine acetyltransferase; acetyl CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.5), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of thepineal hormone melatonin. In the normal diurnal light-dark cycle there is greater physiological stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor in the pineal during the night than during the day. Pineals from rats kept in constant light for 24 hr possess more hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase and specifically bind more l-[3H]alprenolol than do pineals from rats kept in the dark overnight. When rats, exposed to light for 24 hr, are treated with the beat-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, there is a rapid loss of both hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity and specific l-[3H]alprenolol binding sites. There is no change in the affinity of adenylate cyclase for isoproterenol or for its substrate, ATP. Similarly, although there are fewer binding sites, there is no change in the affinity of the remaining sites for either agonist or antagonist. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide does not affect the loss of either adenylate cyclase activity or specific binding sites. The data suggest that stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor causes a rapid decrease in the number of available receptors and in hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity; conversely, lack of stimulation causes an increase in these parameters. It is suggested that these changes contribute to the phenomena of super- and subsensitivity in the pineal gland by regulating the capacity of the pineal to synthesize cyclic AMP in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.",1975,0,231,0,0,10,14,27,30,22,20,11,35,6

c90e009e24b379418f9471f5b4d740adee959e90,An approximate quantum theory of the antiferromagnetic ground state,"Abstract The new mechanism is proposed ensuring the sustainability of spin sublattices system to the effect of mutual switching of the spins of different sublattices.Such switching destroys the ferromagnetic order in the sublattices—the effect of exchange intermixing of the sublattices—that should increase the entropy of the antiferromagnetic state.The total destruction of the ferromagnetic order in sublattices determined from the principle of maximum entropy cannot occur being accompanied by a rather rapid increase in energy.At present, the model of the suppression of entropic destruction of sublattices by the growth of the exchange energy is generally accepted.This model was independently proposed by Anderson and Ziman.The mechanism proposed in this paper for suppressing the exchange mixing by increasing the magnetic anisotropy energy turned out to be more effective than the growth of the exchange energy in the Anderson-Ziman model.Surprising here is that this result was obtained under the condition that the magnetic interactions V A determining the energy of the magnetic anisotropy are small enough compared with the Coulomb exchange interaction V ex .It turned out that the reason for such an anomalously strong influence of V A is related to the symmetry difference between the operators V ex and V A .The V ex operator is spatially isotropic, therefore it determines only the mutual orientation of the interacting spins and doesn’t affect their orientation relative to the crystal axes.The V A operator removes this degeneracy.The removal of degeneracy shifts weakly the levels of the exchange energy due to V A ≪ V ex condition, but it strongly changes the forms of the wave functions.It is established that such a change in the wave functions can ensure the formation of spin sublattices, which are absent in the degenerate state.This mechanism of sublattice formation was justified mathematically for the model operators V ex mod and V A mod .Such choice of the V ex mod and V A mod operators ensured the possibility of obtaining the exact solutions of the equations V ex mod Φ 0 mod = E 0 mod Φ 0 mod and ( V ex mod + V A mod ) Φ mod = E mod Φ mod . This excludes the dependence of the obtained results with any approximations used to simplify calculations. Using the properties of the Φ 0 mod and Φ mod functions allowed us to generalize the obtained result for the spins bound by the exchange interaction in the approximation of the nearest neighbors. The stability conditions of this solution are yet to be studied.",2019,24,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Analysis of mice carrying targeted mutations in individual and multiple Hox genes is beginning to reveal a complex network of interactions among these closely related genes which is responsible for directing the formation of spatially restricted tissues and structures. In this report we present an analysis of the genetic interactions between all members of the third paralogous group, Hoxa3, Hoxb3, and Hoxd3. Previous analysis has shown that although mice homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in either Hoxa3 or Hoxd3 have no defects in common, mice mutant for both genes demonstrate that these two genes strongly interact in a dosage-dependent manner. To complete the analysis of this paralogous gene family, mice with a targeted disruption of the Hoxb3 gene were generated. Homozygous mutants have minor defects at low penetrance in the formation of both the cervical vertebrae and the IXth cranial nerve. Analysis and comparison of all double-mutant combinations demonstrate that all three members of this paralogous group interact synergistically to affect the development of both neuronal and mesenchymal neural crest-derived structures, as well as somitic mesoderm-derived structures. Surprisingly, with respect to the formation of the cervical vertebrae, mice doubly mutant for Hoxa3 and Hoxd3 or Hoxb3 and Hoxd3 show an indistinguishable defect, loss of the entire atlas. This suggests that the identity of the specific Hox genes that are functional in a given region may not be as critical as the total number of Hox genes operating in that region.",1997,74,169,8,1,4,7,14,12,7,11,10,5,2

Such mosaics allow one to determine the cell type in which a gene is active. We find that the maroon-like maternal effect is (1) autonomous to the germ line and (2) dose sensitive in germ-line mosaics. Aldehyde oxidase activity is used as a histological probe to investigate the tissue and temporal distribution of mal+ activity in the developing ovary. The adult ovary shows mal+ activity in the germ line at all discernible stages of oogenesis but no activity is observed in the mesodermally derived follicle cells. Differential mal+ activity is observed even in the ovary of the third-instar larvae.",1977,10,20,0,0,3,2,2,1,2,1,2,1,0

Vibrationally excited (v” ⩽ 6) cyanogen radicals were produced and observed spectroscopically in absorption, in the δv = 0, ± 1 and — 2 sequences of the violet (B2∑ ← X2∑) system. The CN radical produced in the reaction CNR + hv → CN(X2∑, v = 0) + R is excited electronically, CN(X2∑, v = 0)+hv → CN (B2∑, v = 0, 1, 2, ...), and then returns to various vibrational levels of the ground state by fluorescence or collision CN(B2∑, v = 0, 1, 2, ...) → CN(X2∑, v = 0, 1, 2, ...) + hv, CN(B2∑, v = 0, 1, 2, ...) + M → CN(X2∑, v = 0, 1, 2, ...) + M. Frequent repetition of this type of excitation in the absence of relaxation would lead to a vibrational ‘tem perature’ which may be described as virtually infinite, and in any case is extremely high when relaxation is relatively slow. The alternative reactions by which vibrationally excited radicals could be produced, namely CNR + hv → CN(X2∑, v ⩽ 6) + R and CNR + hv → CN(A2II, v > 0) + R, followed by CN(A2II, v > 0) → CN(X2∑, v > 0), were shown to account for < 6 % of the vibrationally excited radicals observed and may be entirely inoperative. The probability of energy transfer to CNBr from the fourth vibrational level of CN, P4-3, was found to be approximately 1 × 10-2. The rate constant for the recombination of cyanogen radicals at room temperature was found to be ~ 6 x 1011 ml. mole-1 s-1 or ~ 1.7 × 1016 ml.2 mole-2 s-1 with nitrogen as third body.",1963,2,37,1,0,2,4,2,1,1,3,1,1,0

Normally, the proportion of cardiomyocytes produced from this lineage is limited, not because of poor differentiation capacity as previously thought, but because of stage-specific changes in the activity of the bone morphogenetic protein pathway. Transient bone morphogenetic protein antagonism efficiently directs mouse iPSCs toward the CNC lineage and, consequently, the generation of cKit+ CNCs with full capacity to form cardiomyocytes and other CNC derivatives in vitro. These findings resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the role of cKit in the heart, and are expected to lead to the development of novel stem cell-based therapies for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. The degree to which cKit-expressing progenitors generate cardiomyocytes in the heart is controversial. Genetic fate-mapping studies suggest minimal contribution; however, whether or not minimal contribution reflects minimal cardiomyogenic capacity is unclear because the embryonic origin and role in cardiogenesis of these progenitors remain elusive. Using high-resolution genetic fate-mapping approaches with cKitCreERT2/+ and Wnt1::Flpe mouse lines, we show that cKit delineates cardiac neural crest progenitors (CNCkit). CNCkit possess full cardiomyogenic capacity and contribute to all CNC derivatives, including cardiac conduction system cells. Furthermore, by modeling cardiogenesis in cKitCreERT2-induced pluripotent stem cells, we show that, paradoxically, the cardiogenic fate of CNCkit is regulated by bone morphogenetic protein antagonism, a signaling pathway activated transiently during establishment of the cardiac crescent, and extinguished from the heart before CNC invasion. Together, these findings elucidate the origin of cKit+ cardiac progenitors and suggest that a nonpermissive cardiac milieu, rather than minimal cardiomyogenic capacity, controls the degree of CNCkit contribution to myocardium.",2015,57,92,3,3,18,17,19,13,12,7,0,0,0

Basic information on the processes of generation and absorption of gamma-rays, as well as the results of observations for various gamma-ray photon energies are reported.In the region of soft gamma-ray emission (i.e., for energies less than tens of MeV), where emission in gamma-ray lines dominates, we also discuss the nature of gamma-ray bursts, the origin of gamma-ray emission from the galactic centre, etc.Discrete sources and, in particular, the mysterious source Cyg X-3 are discussed in the region of very high (Eγ > 1012 eV) and ultra-high (Eγ > 1015 eV) energy gamma-ray emission.A larger portion of the review is devoted to the analysis of cosmic-ray origin on the basis of the available gamma-ray data in the region from several tens of MeV to several GeV. The peculiarity of this energy range is, in particular, in the fact that the diffuse galactic emission was observed mainly there. We also discuss the problem of determination of the cosmic-ray density gradient from the gamma-ray data.The origin of high-latitude gamma-ray emission, the problem of galactic gamma-ray halo, etc., are discussed.The theoretical models explaining the nature of unidentified gamma-ray sources, as well as the results of measurements and theoretical estimations of a gamma-ray flux from SN1987A are analysed.",1985,102,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

We report a technique for covalent labeling of newly synthesized proteins of interest based on drug-dependent preservation of epitope tags. Epitope tags are removed from proteins of interest immediately after translation by the activity of a sequence-specific protease until the time a protease inhibitor is added, after which newly synthesized protein copies retain their tags. This method, which we call TimeSTAMP for time-specific tagging for the age measurement of proteins, allows sensitive and nonperturbative visualization and quantification of newly synthesized proteins of interest with exceptionally tight temporal control. We demonstrate applications of TimeSTAMP in retrospectively identifying growing synapses in cultured neurons and in visualizing the distribution of recently synthesized proteins in intact fly brains.",2008,55,63,5,2,4,10,4,5,6,1,6,2,3

071924898b2c8a5977424e66287ff5673474db86,INHIBITION IN THE EYE OF LIMULUS,"In the compound lateral eye of Limulus each ommatidium functions as a single receptor unit in the discharge of impulses in the optic nerve. Impulses originate in the eccentric cell of each ommatidium and are conducted in its axon, which runs without interruption through an extensive plexus of nerve fibers to become a fiber of the optic nerve. The plexus makes interconnections among the ommatidia, but its exact organization is not understood. The ability of an ommatidium to discharge impulses in the axon of its eccentric cell is reduced by illumination of other ommatidia in its neighborhood: the threshold to light is raised, the number of impulses discharged in response to a suprathreshold flash of light is diminished, and the frequency with which impulses are discharged during steady illumination is decreased. Also, the activity that can be elicited under certain conditions when an ommatidium is in darkness can be inhibited similarly. There is no evidence for the spread of excitatory influences in the eye of Limulus. The inhibitory influence exerted upon an ommatidium that is discharging impulses at a steady rate begins, shortly after the onset of the illumination on neighboring ommatidia, with a sudden deep minimum in the frequency of discharge. After partial recovery, the frequency is maintained at a depressed level until the illumination on the neighboring receptors is turned off, following which there is prompt, though not instantaneous recovery to the original frequency. The inhibition is exerted directly upon the sensitive structure within the ommatidium: it has been observed when the impulses were recorded by a microelectrode thrust into an ommatidium, as well as when they were recorded more proximally in single fibers dissected from the optic nerve. Receptor units of the eye often inhibit one another mutually. This has been observed by recording the activity of two optic nerve fibers simultaneously. The mediation of the inhibitory influence appears to depend upon the integrity of nervous interconnections in the plexus: cutting the lateral connections to an ommatidium abolishes the inhibition exerted upon it. The nature of the influence that is mediated by the plexus and the mechanism whereby it exerts its inhibitory action on the receptor units are not known. The depression of the frequency of the discharge of nerve impulses from an ommatidium increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the intensity of illumination on receptors in its vicinity. Inhibition of the discharge from an ommatidium is greater the larger the area of the eye illuminated in its vicinity. However, equal increments of area become less effective as the total area is increased. The response of an ommatidium is most effectively inhibited by the illumination of ommatidia that are close to it; the effectiveness diminishes with increasing distance, but may extend for several millimeters. Illumination of a fixed region of the eye at constant intensity produces a depression of the frequency of discharge of impulses from a nearby ommatidium that is approximately constant, irrespective of the level of excitation of the ommatidium. The inhibitory interaction in the eye of Limulus is an integrative process that is important in determining the patterns of nervous activity in the visual system. It is analogous to the inhibitory component of the interaction that takes place in the vertebrate retina. Inhibitory interaction results in the exaggeration of differences in sensory activity from different regions of the eye illuminated at different intensities, thus enhancing visual contrast.",1956,25,435,5,2,5,8,9,5,7,10,7,9,8

Hodgkin and Huxley(1952) had provided the basis for understanding the nerve action poten- tial. The concept of chemical transmission at synapses had received its experimental verification by detailed studies on excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic po- tentials (see Katz, 1966, for a concise description of the electrical signals in nerve and muscle). The ques- tion of the molecular mechanisms underlying these signals was still open, however. Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) used the concept of voltage-operated gates for a formal description of conductance changes, and by 1970 the terms Nat channel and K’channel were used frequently (see review by Hille, 1970), although no direct evidence for the existence of channels was availablefrom biological preparations.Thiswasdiffer- ent for the case of artificial membranes. Miller and Rudin (1963) introduced “black-lipid membranes” as experimental model systems, which in many respects resemble the bimolecular lipid membrane of living cells. These membranes are rather good insulators. However, when they are doped with certain antibiot- ics or proteins they become electrically conductive. R. C. Bean et al. (1969) and Hladky and Haydon (1970) showed that some of these dopants induce discrete, step-like changes in conductance when they are added in trace amounts. All the evidence suggested that the conductance changes observed represent the insertion of single pore-like structures into the mem- branes. In biological membranes similar measurements were not possible at the time, since the methods avail- able for recording currents in living cells typically had background noise levels higher by about a factor of a hundred than the “single-channel currents” ob- served in bilayers (see Figure 1). Indirect methods, however, provided strong evidence that channels similar in conductance to those in artificial mem- branes should be operative in nerve and muscle cells. Early attempts to count the number of Na’ channels by tetrodotoxin binding indicated that the contribu- tion of a single channel to Na+ conductance might be as much as 500 pS. Later, the technique of noise analysis (Katz and Miledi, 1972; Neher and Stevens, 1977) provided more accurate numbers.

Predicted terpene cyclases were classified into three groups: sesquiterpene, diterpene, and other terpene cyclases. Genes of the terpene cyclase group that form an operon with a gene encoding S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase were found in genome data of seven microorganisms belonging to actinomycetes, Streptomyces ambofaciens ISP5053, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), Streptomyces griseus IFO13350, Streptomyces lasaliensis NRRL3382R, Streptomyces scabies 87.22, Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL2338, and Micromonospora olivasterospora KY11048. Among six microorganisms tested, S. ambofaciens, S. coelicolor A3(2), S. griseus, and S. lasaliensis produced 2-MIB but M. olivasterospora produced 2-methylenebornane (2-MB) instead. The regions containing monoterpene cyclase and methyltransferase genes were amplified by PCR from S. ambofaciens, S. lasaliensis, and Saccharopolyspora erythraea, respectively, and their genes were heterologously expressed in Streptomyces avermitilis, which was naturally deficient of 2-MIB biosynthesis by insertion and deletion. All exoconjugants of S. avermitilis produced 2-MIB. Full-length recombinant proteins, monoterpene cyclase and methyltransferase of S. lasaliensis were expressed at high level in Escherichia coli. The recombinant methyltransferase catalyzed methylation at the C2 position of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) in the presence of SAM. 2-MIB was generated by incubation with GPP, SAM, recombinant methyltransferase, and terpene cyclase. We concluded that the biosynthetic pathway involves the methylation of GPP by GPP methyltransferase and its subsequent cyclization by monoterpene cyclase to 2-MIB.",2008,52,169,3,2,6,7,17,12,9,17,18,15,11

This TrB-1a–cell subset was lost in the absence of IκBNS, thus revealing a requirement for intact NF-κB signaling via IκBNS during this stage of the development of B-1 cells. Learning more about the development of B-1 cells may reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. B-1 cells mediate early protection against infection by responding to T cell-independent (TI) antigens found on the surface of various pathogens. Mice with impaired expression of the atypical IκB protein IκBNS have markedly reduced frequencies of B-1 cells. We used a mouse strain with dysfunctional IκBNS derived from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) screen, named bumble, to investigate the point in the development of B-1 cells where IκBNS is required. The presence of wild-type (wt) peritoneal cells in mixed wt/bumble chimeras did not rescue the development of bumble B-1 cells, but wt peritoneal cells transferred to bumble mice restored natural IgM levels and response to TI antigens. The bumble and wt mice displayed similar levels of fetal liver B-1 progenitors and splenic neonatal transitional B (TrB) cells, both of which were previously shown to give rise to B-1 cells. Interestingly, we found that a subset of wt neonatal TrB cells expressed common B-1a markers (TrB-1a) and that this cell population was absent in the bumble neonatal spleen. Sorted TrB-1a (CD93+IgM+CD5+) cells exclusively generated B-1a cells when adoptively transferred, whereas sorted CD93+IgM+CD5− cells gave rise to B-2 cells and, to a lesser extent, B-1b and B-1a cells. This study identifies a phenotypically distinct splenic population of TrB-1a cells and establishes that the development of B-1a cells is blocked before this stage in the absence of IκBNS.",2014,43,37,2,0,5,3,7,8,8,4,2,0,0

Expression of PrPC in the host organism is necessary for prion replication and for prion neurotoxicity. Understanding prion diseases necessitates detailed structural insights into PrPC and PrPSc. Towards this goal, we have developed a comprehensive collection of monoclonal antibodies denoted POM1 to POM19 and directed against many different epitopes of mouse PrPC. Three epitopes are located within the N-terminal octarepeat region, one is situated within the central unstructured region, and four epitopes are discontinuous within the globular C-proximal domain of PrPC. Some of these antibodies recognize epitopes that are resilient to protease digestion in PrPSc. Other antibodies immunoprecipitate PrPC, but not PrPSc. A third group was found to immunoprecipitate both PrP isoforms. Some of the latter antibodies could be blocked with epitope-mimicking peptides, and incubation with an excess of these peptides allowed for immunochromatography of PrPC and PrPSc. Amino-proximal antibodies were found to react with repetitive PrPC epitopes, thereby vastly increasing their avidity. We have also created functional single-chain miniantibodies from selected POMs, which retained the binding characteristics despite their low molecular mass. The POM collection, thus, represents a unique set of reagents allowing for studies with a variety of techniques, including western blotting, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, conformation-dependent immunoassays, and plasmon surface plasmon resonance-based assays.",2008,28,152,10,0,4,13,13,19,11,15,14,7,11

In vitro, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and interleukin-11 display overlapping activities with IL-6. This functional redundancy may be explained by the interactions of specific binding receptors with a common signal-transducing receptor (gp130) (for reviews see refs 3, 4). To elucidate the unique function of IL-6 in vivo, we have disrupted the IL-6 gene by homologous recombination. IL-6-deficient mice develop normally. They fail to control efficiently vaccinia virus and infection with Listeria monocytogenes, a facultative intracellular bacterium. The T-cell-dependent antibody response against vesicular stomatitis virus is impaired. Further, the inflammatory acute-phase response after tissue damage or infection is severely compromised, whereas it is only moderately affected after challenge with lipopolysaccharide.

Nimodipine caused a dose-dependent decrease in the DA metabolite 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) in striatum and the limbic region. If the brains were microwave radiated immediately after decapitation in order to minimize post-mortal accumulation of 3-MT, the effect of nimodipine was less pronounced and statistically not significant. Nimodipine markedly decreased the accumulation of 3-MT induced by pargyline, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, a phenomenon that was not attenuated by microwave radiation. Furthermore, whereas nimodipine had no effect on mouse motor activity when given alone it readily blocked the pargyline-induced increase in activity. The concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in striatum and the limbic region were also reduced by nimodipine as was the accumulation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) measured after inhibition of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase by 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015). In addition, nimodipine caused decreased concentrations of DA and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the limbic region but not in striatum. Nimodipine caused an increase in the striatal concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA); these changes were not seen in the limbic region. In conclusion, nimodipine appears to reduce the release as well as the synthesis of DA in mouse brain.

We recorded grid cells while rats were trained in two rectangular compartments, A and B (each 1 m × 2 m), separated by a wall. Once distinct grid maps were established in each environment, we removed the partition and allowed the rat to explore the merged environment (2 m × 2 m). The grid patterns were largely retained along the distal walls of the box. Nearer the former partition line, individual grid fields changed location, resulting almost immediately in local spatial periodicity and continuity between the two original maps.

To study the distribution of coated pits and coated vesicles in fibroblasts by immunochemical techniques at both the light and electron microscopic levels, we immunized rabbits with coat protein extracted from bovine brain-coated vesicles. The resulting anti-coat protein antibody was directed predominantly against clathrin, the 180,ooo dalton protein that constitutes the major component of coat protein. By indirect immunoperoxidase electron microscopy, the anti-coat protein antibody was observed to bind specifically to coated pits on the surface of human fibroblasts and to coated vesicles within the cell. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining techniques at the light microscopic level revealed that the coat protein was distributed in fibroblasts in two distinctive patterns: as discrete foci on or near the cell surface that were linearly aligned in association with phase-dense cellular fibers (first pattern), and as intracellular foci that were randomly arranged around the cell nucleus (second pattern). The distribution of coat protein in fibroblasts was compared with the distribution of ferritin-labeled LDL, which was studied with the use of similar electron microscopic and immunofluorescence techniques. As previously reported, electron microscopic studies revealed that the LDL-ferritin binding sites at 4 degrees C were clustered in coated pits. By immunofluorescence microscopy, the LDL-ferritin that was bound to receptors within coated pits was shown to be arranged linearly over the cell surface in a pattern that was similar to the linear arrangement of coat protein (first pattern). Considered together, the current data indicate that coated pits in human fibroblasts contain a protein analogous to clathrin, and that those coated pits which contain receptors for LDL are located over intracellular fibers most likely corresponding to stress fibers. These observationa may have relevance to the mechanisms by which the coated pit-coated vesicle system efficiently delivers recptor-bound ligands to lysosomes.",1978,33,177,3,0,5,8,24,19,17,10,5,10,4

They allowed the first synthesis of isotactic and syndiotactic polymers and of the four pure stereoisomers of polybutadiene, that is: the polymers having 1,2-isotactic, 1,2-syndiotactic, 1,4-cis, and 1,4-trans enchainments. The structure of catalytic complexes, that promove the stereospecific polymerization in the ionic coordinated catalysis, is pointed out. They are electron deficient complexes containing bridge-bonds between very electropositive transition metals, with valence less than the maximum, and very electropositive metals with very small ion diameter, to which electronegative carbon atoms are coordinated. Some soluble complexes, based on Titanium and Aluminum, are described, that act as catalysts in homogeneous solution. The best stereospecific catalysts for the synthesis of isotactic polymers are heterogeneous ones and their stereospecificity is connected with the presence of a crystalline substrate, formed by a layer lattice on which the active centers contain chemisorbed or epitattely bound metallorganic complexes (that may exist in enantiomorphous forms).",1958,8,33,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,1,0,0,1

eff45f42f7e9911c91fd9d7073688f592d77b527,Quantum transitions and dressed unstable states,"We consider the problem of the meaning of quantum unstable states including their dressing. According to both Dirac and Heitler this problem has not been solved in the usual formulation of quantum mechanics. A precise definition of excited states is still needed to describe quantum transitions. We use our formulation given in terms of density matrices outside the Hilbert space. We obtain a dressed unstable state for the Friedrichs model, which is the simplest model that incorporates both bare and dressed quantum states. The excited unstable state is derived from the stable states through analytic continuation. It is given by an irreducible density matrix with broken time symmetry. It can be expressed by a superposition of Gamow density operators. The main difference from previous studies is that excited states are not factorizable into wave functions. The dressed unstable state satisfies all the criteria that we can expect: it has a real average energy and a nonvanishing trace. The average energy differs from Green's function energy by a small effect starting with fourth order in the coupling constant. Our state decays following a Markovian equation. There are no deviations from exponential decay neither for short nor for long times, as ismore » the case for the bare state. The dressed state satisfies an uncertainty relation between energy and lifetime. We can also define dressed photon states and describe how the energy of the excited state is transmitted to the photons. There is another very important aspect: deviations from exponential decay would be in contradiction with indiscernibility as one could define, e.g., old mesons and young mesons according to their lifetime. This problem is solved by showing that quantum transitions are the result of two processes: a dressing process, discussed in a previous publication, and a decay process, which is much slower for electrodynamic systems. During the dressing process the unstable state is prepared. Then the dressed state decays in a purely exponential way. In the Hilbert space the two processes are not separated. Therefore it is not astonishing that we obtain for the unstable dressed state an irreducible density matrix outside the Liouville-Hilbert-space. This is a limit of Hilbert space states that are arbitrarily close to the decaying state. There are experiments that could verify our proposal. A typical one would be the study of the line shape, which is due to the superposition of the short-time process and the long-time process. The long-time process taken separately leads to a much sharper line shape, and avoids the divergence of the fluctuation predicted by the Lorentz line shape.« less",2001,0,36,0,1,1,5,9,0,2,2,2,3,2

The latter are obtained from the classical expressions for the energy-momentum densities simply by multiplication with Ω. Each field component is considered as an operator (for the whole volume Ω) and is not regarded as a function of the co-ordinates at all. Between the field components we have established very simple commutation laws, analogous to the ordinary law pq—qp = ℏ/i which depend on the transformation character of the field considered. For example, for the scalar meson field (potential v, its gradient f, its time derivative g; * means Hermitean adjoint; [a,b] means ab—ba): Here the vector k is just an abbreviation for the commutators; it is a dynamical variable, but in virtue of the commutation laws a constant of motion, that is, it commutes with all field quantities, with the energy and the momentum.",1944,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The addition of chemical inducers to cotransformed cells results in a 5 to 50 fold increase in the level of mRNA transcribed from the exogenous globin gene. S1 nuclease and primer extension analyses demonstrate that these mRNAs initiate and terminate correctly. Nuclear transcription experiments indicate that induction of hybrid mRNA results at least in part from the increase in the rate of globin gene transcription. Furthermore, the induction appears to be specific for globin genes within an erythroid cell. These results permit the study of expression of the globin gene during erythroid differentiation and suggest that the specific induction of the globin gene is an inherent property of DNA sequences within or flanking the beta-globin genes. Moreover, the fact that the human and hybrid globin genes are both inducible in MEL cells suggests that these regulatory sequences are conserved between mouse and human cells.",1983,55,125,0,7,30,16,16,16,8,8,5,7,1

In various experimental cancers, treatment with antagonists of bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (BN/GRP) produces a reduction in EGFRs, concomitant to inhibition of tumor growth. To investigate the mechanisms involved, we monitored concentrations of BN/GRP antagonist RC-3095 in serum of mice, rats, and hamsters given a single subcutaneous or intravenous injection of this analog. In parallel studies, we measured levels and mRNA expression of EGFRs in estrogen-dependent and independent MXT mouse mammary cancers, following a single subcutaneous administration of RC-3095 to tumor-bearing mice. Peak values of RC-3095 in serum were detected 2 min after intravenous or 15 min after subcutaneous injection. The levels of RC-3095 declined rapidly and became undetectable after 3-5 hr. In the estrogen-dependent MXT tumors, the concentration of EGF receptors was reduced by about 60% 6 hr following injection and returned to original level after 24 hr. Levels of mRNA for EGFR fell parallel with the receptor number and were nearly normal after 24 hr. In the hormone-independent MXT cancers, the number of EGFRs decreased progressively, becoming undetectable 6 hr after injection of RC-3095, and returned to normal values at 24 hr, but EGFR mRNA levels remained lower for 48 hr. Thus, in spite of rapid elimination from serum, BN/GRP antagonist RC-3095 can induce a prolonged decrease in levels and mRNA expression of EGFRs. These findings may explain how single daily injections of BN/GRP antagonists can maintain tumor growth inhibition.",1997,51,54,0,1,0,4,2,2,1,2,5,2,6
8f0a394be1f4d408c8695fb2caae53f69c94bbe9,Molecular switch in signal transduction: reaction paths of the conformational changes in ras p21.,"Conformational changes in ras p21 triggered by the hydrolysis of GTP play an essential role in the signal transduction pathway. The path for the conformational change is determined by molecular dynamics simulation with a holonomic constraint directing the system from the known GTP-bound structure (with the gamma-phosphate removed) to the GDP-bound structure. The simulation is done with a shell of water molecules surrounding the protein. In the switch I region, the side chain of Tyr-32, which undergoes a large displacement, moves through the space between loop 2 and the rest of the protein, rather than on the outside of the protein. As a result, the charged residues Glu-31 and Asp-33, which interact with Raf in the homologous RafRBD-Raps complex, remain exposed during the transition. In the switch II region, the conformational changes of alpha2 and loop 4 are strongly coupled. A transient hydrogen bonding complex between Arg-68 and Tyr-71 in the switch II region and Glu-37 in switch I region stabilizes the intermediate conformation of alpha2 and facilitates the unwinding of a helical turn of alpha2 (residues 66-69), which in turn permits the larger scale motion of loop 4. Hydrogen bond exchange between the protein and solvent molecules is found to be important in the transition. Possible functional implications of the results are discussed.",1997,39,151,7,0,2,2,7,5,11,7,4,5,11
b719f15e5a6a3d31ccf157ebb5b37558f46c1801,Interorganelle transfer and glycosylation of yeast invertase in vitro.,"Core glycosylated proteins formed in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are transported to the Golgi body, where oligosaccharides are elongated by addition of outer-chain carbohydrate. The transport process is blocked in a temperature-sensitive secretion mutant (sec18) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which accumulates core glycosylated invertase (product of SUC2; EC 3.2.1.26) in the ER. To approach the molecular mechanism of this transport process, we have devised a reaction in which core glycosylated invertase, accumulated in sec18 cells, is transferred to the Golgi body in vitro. For this purpose, membranes from sec18, SUC2 cells that are also defective in an outer chain alpha-1----3-mannosyltransferase (mnnl) are mixed with membranes from a strain that contains the transferase but is deficient in invertase (MNNl, delta SUC2). Transfer is detected by the acquisition of outer-chain alpha-1----3-linked mannose residues dependent on both donor and recipient membranes. The reaction is temperature and detergent sensitive and requires ATP, GDP-mannose, Mg2+, and Mn2+, and the product invertase remains associated with sedimentable membranes. Treatment of donor, but not acceptor, membranes with N-ethylmaleimide or trypsin inactivates transfer competence. These characteristics suggest that the ER, or a vesicle derived from the ER, contributes invertase to a chemically distinct compartment where mannosyl modification is executed.",1986,1,43,2,0,3,12,4,0,4,3,1,0,2
dbbd5eeae087d9df00a64208a68059531aa7856b,Ventilatory drive in chronic pulmonary emphysema.,"Abstract 1.1. The studies reported in this paper confirm the well documented observation that some patients with chronic pulmonary emphysema manifest an abnormally small increase in minute ventilation when CO 2 is added to inspired air. This diminished ventilatory response, despite a considerable increase in arterial P co 2 , is characteristic of patients with chronic pulmonary emphysema who also have chronic CO 2 retention. 2.2. The mechanism underlying the abnormal ventilatory response in these patients appears to be a selective depression of the respiratory center to the stimulus of increased arterial blood P CO 2 and/or hydrogen ion concentration, since responsiveness to other stimuli such as exercise is well maintained. Restriction in the ventilatory capacity of the chest bellows is not the limiting factor to increase in minute ventilation during CO 2 breathing in patients with emphysema and CO 2 retention; by way of contrast, this restriction may suffice to limit the ventilatory response to the CO 2 stimulus in some patients with emphysema but without CO 2 retention. 3.3. The poor ventilatory response to the CO 2 stimulus is generally not reversible in patients with CO 2 retention of long duration even though the arterial blood P CO 2 and alkali reserve may be restored toward normal levels as a result of prolonged administration of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, diamox. 4.4. In addition to its action in decreasing the alkali reserve, diamox also reduces the arterial blood P CO 2 . The mechanism of this action is not established. 5.5. The relief or aggravation of hypoxemia within the physiologic range has little effect on the ventilatory response to inspired CO 2 in patients with emphysema and CO 2 retention. This suggests that the hypoxic stimulus is rather weak; however, as is well known, breathing pure O 2 consistently depresses the ventilatory response. The contrast between these observations emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between the physiologic and pharmacologic levels of O 2 tension in the blood. 6.6. The therapeutic implications of these observations, in patients with chronic pulmonary emphysema, are threefold. First, a distinction must be made between the effect of reduced ventilatory drive, and considerable restriction in ventilatory capacity in limiting minute ventilation. Second, attention must be focused on the means for prevention and prompt relief of CO 2 retention. The role of diamox and of mechanical hyperventilation in the various stages of the disease has been described in this connection. Finally, by mobilizing large stores of Co 2 from the body, continuous diamox therapy in patients with prolonged CO 2 retention may restore mental alertness and a sense of well-being and diminish the threat of CO 2 narcosis.",1955,19,80,0,0,3,8,7,5,4,4,1,2,2

Current viral vectors are efficient at introducing transgenic sequences but result in random integrations. Gene targeting, in contrast, can directly correct an affected gene, or incorporate corrective sequences into a site free from undesirable side effects, but efficiency is low. Most current targeting procedures, consequently, use positive-negative selection with drugs, often requiring >/=10 days. This drug selection causes problems with stem cells that differentiate in this time or require feeder cells, because the feeders must be drug resistant and so are not eliminated by the selection. To overcome these problems, we have developed a procedure for isolating gene-corrected stem cells free from feeder cells after 3-5 days culture without drugs. The method is still positive-negative, but the positive and negative drug-resistance genes are replaced with differently colored fluorescence genes. Gene-corrected cells are isolated by FACS. We tested the method with mouse ES cells having a mutant hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) gene and grown on feeder cells. After 5 days in culture, gene-corrected cells were obtained free from feeder cells at a ""purity"" of >30%, enriched >2,000-fold and with a recovery of approximately 20%. Corrected cells were also isolated singly for clonal expansion. Our FACS-based procedure should be applicable at small or large scale to stem cells that can be cultured (with feeder cells, if necessary) for >/=3 days.",2005,24,11,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

In 95% nitrogen/5% carbon dioxide, endothelium-derived nitric oxide was not a factor in the development or maintenance of low resting aortic ring tensions. However, the production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide increased in 21% oxygen/74% nitrogen/5% carbon dioxide and 95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide, and attenuated a concomitant endothelium-independent mechanism of increasing vascular tension. A protein kinase inhibitor, 0.2 mM 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methyl piperazine (H-7) inhibited oxygen-mediated constriction of neonatal vessels, but also significantly reduced the contractile response to 60 mM KCl. In conclusion, resting aortic tension is in part determined by oxygen-mediated control of the production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide and one or more opposing endothelium-independent mechanisms of constriction.",1992,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

While the synthesis of the tetracationic cyclophane, [BBIPYBIXYCY]4+ from bipyridine (BP) and 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene (BBB), directed by the template, 1,5–bis[2(2–hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy]naphthalene(1/5BHEEN) becomes less efficient (23 to 5%) under ultra-high pressure reaction conditions (12 kbars), the self-assembly of {[2]-[BPP34C10]-[BBIPYBIXYCY] catenane}4+ from BP and BBB in the presence of BPP34C10 can be achieved with increased efficiency (18 to 42%) at 12 kbars. This difference in the trends of the yields can be ascribed to the enhanced templating action of BPP34C10 relative to that of 1/5BHEEN when two moles of BP and two moles of BBB are being employed to construct the tetracationic cyclophane. The self-assembly of the [2]catenane from BP, BBB, and BPP34C10 has been followed by 1H NMR spectroscopy in D7-DMF solution. On the basis of this spectroscopic evidence and supporting chemical data, the formation of {[2]-[BPP34C10]-[BBIPYBIXYCY] catenane}4+ from two moles of BP, two moles of BBB, and one mole of BPP34C10 is believed to proceed via the monoquatemary intermediate, [MBXYBIPY]+, which has not been isolated, and the dicationic species, [BBIPYXY]2+, which has been isolated and shown to be an intermediate in the self-assembly process leading to the [2]catenane, presumably via the [BXYBBIPYXY]3+ trication — the final intermediate which again has not been isolated.",1992,35,20,0,0,0,1,1,2,3,2,0,1,0

A deeper understanding of the pathological changes occurring in this disease will suggest novel drug targets and help identify biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. The involvement of p11 in depression and the response to antidepressants is well documented. Up to 35% of patients with PD suffer from comorbid depression. We have found that p11 levels are reduced in PD patients, and, specifically, that peripheral leukocyte p11 levels are altered in PD patients both with depression and without depression in a cell-specific manner. These data provide insight into the pathological alterations occurring centrally and peripherally in PD. Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) often suffer from comorbid depression. P11 (S100A10), a member of the S100 family of proteins, is expressed widely throughout the body and is involved in major depressive disorder and antidepressant response. Central p11 levels are reduced in postmortem tissue from depressed individuals; however, p11 has not yet been investigated in PD patients with depression or those without depression. We investigated p11 levels in postmortem PD brains and assessed whether peripheral p11 levels correlate with disease severity. Substantia nigra, putamen, and cortical p11 protein levels were assessed in postmortem brain samples from PD patients and matched controls. In a different set of postmortem brains, p11 mRNA expression was measured in dopaminergic cells from the substantia nigra. Both p11 protein and mRNA levels were decreased in PD patients. Peripheral p11 protein levels were investigated in distinct leukocyte populations from PD patients with depression and those without depression. Monocyte, natural killer (NK) cell, and cytotoxic T-cell p11 levels were positively associated with the severity of PD, and NK cell p11 levels were positively associated with depression scores. Given that inflammation plays a role in both PD and depression, it is intriguing that peripheral p11 levels are altered in immune cells in both conditions. Our data provide insight into the pathological alterations occurring centrally and peripherally in PD. Moreover, if replicated in other cohorts, p11 could be an easily accessible biomarker for monitoring the severity of PD, especially in the context of comorbid depression.",2017,46,20,0,2,2,8,4,4,0,0,0,0,0

Such supernovae yield large quantities of light elements such as carbon but very little iron. The dominance of low-energy supernovae seems surprising, because it had been expected that the first stars were extremely massive, and that they disintegrated in pair-instability explosions that would rapidly enrich galaxies in iron. What has remained unclear is the yield of iron from the first supernovae, because hitherto no star has been unambiguously interpreted as encapsulating the yield of a single supernova. Here we report the optical spectrum of SMSS J031300.36−670839.3, which shows no evidence of iron (with an upper limit of 10−7.1 times solar abundance). Based on a comparison of its abundance pattern with those of models, we conclude that the star was seeded with material from a single supernova with an original mass about 60 times that of the Sun (and that the supernova left behind a black hole). Taken together with the four previously mentioned low-metallicity stars, we conclude that low-energy supernovae were common in the early Universe, and that such supernovae yielded light-element enrichment with insignificant iron. Reduced stellar feedback both chemically and mechanically from low-energy supernovae would have enabled first-generation stars to form over an extended period.

For example, a whole range of membrane-associated processes are considered to be mediated through cholesterol-assisted interactions such as the formation of lipid nanodomains or ‘rafts’. The direct and non-invasive observation of lipid or membrane protein dynamics in living cells, which are believed to occur on small spatial scales, is impeded by the resolution limit of >200nm of a conventional far-field fluorescence microscope or by the limited time resolution of single-particle tracking. We combine single-molecule based techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with stimulated emission depletion (STED) far-field microscopy to accesses a superior spatial and temporal resolution for observing the diffusion characteristics of molecules in the plasma membrane of living cells. Tuning the detection area between 250 nm and 30 nm in diameter, we directly reveal marked differences between different lipid or molecular classes. For example, sphingolipids or ‘raft’-associated proteins are transiently trapped on the nanoscale in cholesterol-mediated molecular complexes.

6d98c25102bc8854c146ccca63bf284b504aca82,Nobel Lecture: Passion for precision*,"In our highly complex and ever changing world it is reassuring to know that certain physical quantities can be measured and predicted with very high precision. Precision measurements have always appealed to me as one of the most beautiful aspects of physics. With better measuring tools, one can look where no one has looked before. More than once, seemingly minute differences between measurement and theory have led to major advances in fundamental knowledge. The birth of modern science itself is intimately linked to the art of accurate measurements. Since Galileo Galilei and Christiaan Huygens invented the pendulum clock, time and frequency have been the quantities that we can measure with the highest precision. Today, it is often a good strategy to transform other quantities such as length or voltage into a frequency in order to make accurate measurement. This is what my friend and mentor Arthur Schawlow at Stanford University had in mind when he advised his students: “Never measure anything but frequency!” Measuring a frequency, that is, counting the number of cycles during a given time interval, is intrinsically a digital procedure that is immune to many sources of noise. Electronic counters that work up to microwave frequencies have long been available. In 1967, the Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures CGPM has defined the second, our unit of time, as the period during which a cesium-133 atom oscillates 9 192 631 770 times on a hyperfine clock transition in the atomic ground state. Today, after 50 years of continuous refinement, microwave cesium atomic clocks reach a precision of 15 decimal digits Audoin and Bernard, 2001 . Even much higher precision is expected from future optical atomic clocks which use atoms or ions oscillating at the frequency of light as the “pendulum.” By slicing time into a hundred thousand times finer intervals, such clocks will greatly extend the frontiers of time and frequency metrology. The long missing clockwork mechanism can now be realized with a femtosecond laser frequency comb, an ultraprecise measuring tool that can link and compare optical frequencies and microwave frequencies phase coherently in a single step. Laser frequency combs provide powerful tools for new tests of fundamental physics laws. Precise comparisons of optical resonance frequencies of atomic hydrogen and other atoms with the microwave frequency of a cesium atomic clock are already establishing sensitive limits for possible slow variations of fundamental constants. Optical high harmonic generation is extending frequency comb techniques into the extreme ultraviolet, opening a new spectral territory to precision laser spectroscopy. Frequency comb techniques are also providing a key to attosecond science by offering control of the electric field of ultrafast laser pulses. Femtosecond laser frequency combs have been highlighted in the citation for the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics. Although perfected only about seven years ago, they have already become standard tools for precision spectroscopy and optical frequency metrology in laboratories around the world. Commercial instruments have quickly moved to the market, and extensive review articles and books have been written on frequency comb techniques Udem et al., 2002; Hannaford, 2005; Ye and Cundiff, 2005 . In this lecture I will try to give my personal perspective on the evolution of these intriguing measuring tools for time and frequency. Far from attempting a comprehensive review, I have selected references that helped guide my own insights along a winding path.",2006,151,591,5,1,12,29,36,29,25,29,48,41,29

The heterogeneous reactions were carried out over the solid acid catalysts in a continuous flow reactor at temperatures between 85 and 170°C under atmospheric pressure. Under the studied conditions (85 to 105°C, 1 atm pressure, WHSV : 1–3 g/g · h) all catalysts studied are suitable for oligomerization of 2-methylpropene. Product distributions show regular temperature dependence: upon increasing temperature the molecular weight of oligomers decreases, with no difference in the selectivity of the catalysts. Transformation of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene in the liquid phase at room temperature shows surprising selectivity using either the hydrated or dehydrated forms of the resinsulfonic acids. In the case of the hydrated forms of the acids, only double bond isomerization takes place. With dehydrated acids oligomerization as well as isomerization occurs.

An a-plane AlGaN/GaN HFET (a-HFET) shows small current collapse with a threshold voltage (Vth = -1.8 V). On the other hand, a c-plane HFET (c-HFET) with the same barrier thickness (20 nm) shows a small current collapse, although Vth was negatively large (Vth = -4 V).



Current collapse in a-HFET was not large compared with that in conventional c-HFET on GaN. A c-HFET on sapphire was also measured. The current collapses in HFETs on sapphire were larger than that in HFETs on a GaN substrate. The current collapses in the thin-barrier c-HFET (Vth = -1.8 V) were particularly large. Therefore, an a-plane device is promising for a small or positive Vth with small current collapse. (© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)",2012,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Immunocytochemistry was followed by silver intensification of the diaminobenzidine end-product. In comparison with untreated control rats, both hypophysectomy and adrenalectomy resulted in a dramatic increase in immunostaining of the CRF-containing perikarya and fibers, particularly those originating from the PVN and terminating in the ME. The staining was more intense in adrenalectomized than in hypophysectomized rats. The CRF-positive fibers emerging from the PVN form a medial, an intermediate and a lateral fiber pathway. The lateral and intermediate CRF tracts leave the dorsolateral part of the PVN and course laterally and medially of the fornix, respectively, then ventrally toward the optic tract. Just dorsal to the optic tract they turn in caudal direction and run parallel with and very close to the basal surface of the hypothalamus; individual fibers then turn medially to terminate in the external layer of the ME. Only a few fibers originate from the medial-ventral part of the PVN (medial pathway). These fibers run in ventral direction along the walls of the 3rd ventricle and terminate in the ME. Thus the majority of CRF fibers, similarly to other peptidergic systems, reach the medial basal hypothalamus from the anterolateral direction.",1983,26,136,3,1,11,15,15,14,15,11,11,9,2

In the large-Q/sup 2/ limit these patterns do not depend on hadron or quark masses m. For modest values of Q/sup 2/ one expects corrections at the level of powers of m/sup 2//Q/sup 2/. We discuss the question whether these mass effects are accessible in perturbation theory, as applied to the twist-2 Wilson coefficients and more generally. Our conclusion is that some part of the mass effects must arise from a nonperturbative origin. We also discuss the corrections which arise from higher orders in perturbation theory for very large Q/sup 2/, where mass effects can perhaps be ignored. The emphasis here is on a characterization of the Q/sup 2/, x domain where higher-order corrections are likely to be unimportant.",1977,0,19,0,2,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

573ec64a9f7429c1039dfb22212fb9624adb42fd,A positive entropy change for guanosine binding and for the chemical step in the Tetrahymena ribozyme reaction.,"The ribozyme derived from the group I intron of Tetrahymena thermophila binds an exogenous guanosine nucleotide, which acts as the nucleophile in the sequence-specific cleavage of oligonucleotides. By examining the temperature dependence of the reaction under conditions where Km = Kd, we conclude the following: (1) Guanosine 5'-monophosphate (pG) binds to the closed ribozyme-oligonucleotide substrate complex with a positive entropy change (delta S degree' = +23 eu) and an enthalpy change (delta H degree') close to zero. This is contrary to the expectation that binding would cause increased order (negative delta S degree) and be driven by a negative delta H degree. (2) Inosine and 2-aminopurine riboside, each lacking two hydrogen-bonding moieties relative to guanosine, also bind with a positive entropy value and an unfavorable (positive) delta H degree'. From this result, we suggest that the hydrogen-bonding moieties make an enthalpic contribution to guanosine binding overcoming an intrinsic unfavorable delta H. (3) At 0 degree C, there is equally tight binding of pG in the presence and absence of oligonucleotide substrate bound to the ribozyme. Thus, energetic interactions responsible for the thermodynamic coupling between pG and oligonucleotide substrate binding seen at higher temperatures are indirect. (4) The activation barrier of the chemical step is stabilized by a positive delta S++ (+31 to 39 eu). This stabilization is seen in four reactions using substrates with two different leaving groups in the presence and absence of pG, suggesting that the entropic contribution is inherent to the active site. The positive delta S values for the chemical step and for the binding of pG can be explained by a conformational change or release of water. Thus, although hydrogen bonding contributes to binding of nucleotides to this RNA enzyme as previously thought, it is these other events which produce a positive delta S that provide the energetic driving force for binding.",1995,0,39,2,1,4,3,1,7,3,3,2,2,1
f235dbf11ee2536e7604ca66b7cfd06858c7fadd,Nobelist: Some Personal Thoughts,"T editorial is one that I was particularly happy to write because it is about an unusual person, who has been for many, many years my mentor, colleague, and friend. It was, indeed, Dr. Murray, then Chief of Plastic Surgery at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (Brigham and Women’s Hospital now) when I was a surgical resident, who inspired me to enter this specialty. Because of the long lead time in publishing this journal, this editorial is obviously appearing many months after the world learned that Dr. Murray had received the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Dr. E. Donnall Thomas (for bone marrow transplantation); both, incidentally, were residents together at the Brigham. Dr. Murray was cited for having performed the first successful kidney transplant from one identical twin to another and later for having pursued research enabling renal transplantation between noncompatible persons through the use of irradiation and drug therapy. I was in my second year at Harvard Medical School when on December 23, 1954, Dr. Murray, along with Dr. Hartwell J. Harrison, urologist, and Dr. John P. Merrill, renologist, accomplished this feat. The operation took 51⁄2 hours and was the first time a human had successfully given an organ to another. It was a magnificent event from the point of view of science and medicine. It also had a magical quality—fulfilling ancient and modern myths and fantasies. The vibrations of the excitement I can sense even now. So newsworthy was the achievement (and, as we know, many, if not most, medical-surgical happenings that are covered by the media are really inflated) that one of the local newspapers planted a “spy” in thehospital chemical laboratory inorder toget the results that would indicate either failure or success. Later, when I was doing my surgical residency at the Brigham from 1956 to 1961, kidney transplantation was a major focus of activity, bringing together at the bedside experts from all over the world and from a multiplicity of disciplines. Those were heady days and nights, filled with work, but also with invigorating expectation. I wish to make clear that I was not a key member or investigator of the transplant team. Nevertheless, despite my lowly position in the hierarchy, I also felt part of a new era in medicine and human thought. The ethical considerations even then were enormous, not to mention what they would soon become. I also recall several years later, as an attending surgeon in the dressing room one medical student say to the other: “Another of these dull kidney transplants I have to scrub on.” It was obviously a tribute to Dr. Murray and all who worked with him to have transformed a spectacular, unique event into the commonplace. That the Nobel Assembly chose Dr. Murray for the prize did not surprise me, since I, along with Originally published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in June of 1991 (Plast Reconstr Surg. 1991;87: 1110–1112). *Deceased.

Identification, biochemical properties, and localization.","We have characterized the biochemical properties of the testis and brain-specific 105-kDa protein which is cross-reacted with an anti-bovine HSP90 antibody. The protein was induced in germ cells by heat stress, resulting in a protein which is one of the heat shock proteins [Kumagai, J., Fukuda, J., Kodama, H., Murata, M., Kawamura, K., Itoh, H. & Tanaka, T. (2000) Eur. J. Biochem.267, 3073-3078]. In the present study, we characterized the biochemical properties of the protein. The 105-kDa protein inhibited the aggregation of citrate synthase as a molecular chaperone in vitro. ATP/MgCl2 has a slight influence of the suppression of the citrate synthase aggregation by the 105-kDa protein. The protein possessed chaperone activity. The protein was able to bind to ATP-Sepharose like the other molecular chaperone HSP70. A partial amino-acid sequence (24 amino-acid residues) of the protein was determined and coincided with those of the mouse testis- and brain-specific APG-1 and osmotic stress protein 94 (OSP94). The 105-kDa protein was detected only in the medulla of the rat kidney sections similar to OSP94 upon immunoblotting. The purified 105-kDa protein was cross-reacted with an antibody against APG-1. These results suggested that APG-1 and OSP94 are both identical to the 105-kDa protein. There were highly homologous regions between the 105-kDa protein/APG-1/OSP94 and HSP90. The region of HSP90 was also an immunoreactive site. An anti-bovine HSP90 antibody may cross-react with the 105-kDa protein similar to HSP90 in the rat testis and brain. We have investigated the localization and developmental induction of the protein in the rat brain. In the immunohistochemical analysis, the protein was mainly detected in the cytoplasm of the nerve and glial cells of the rat brain. Although the 105-kDa protein was localized in all rat brain segments, the expression pattern was fast in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and slow in the cerebellum.",2002,27,22,1,0,2,3,4,2,2,0,2,2,0
391ee2efa47df21944c8fb9e4887cba0dc683431,Translation of the genetic message,"The use of cell-free systems of protein synthesis together with genetic studies has resulted in remarkable advances of our knowledge on the mechanism of protein biosynthesis and the genetic code. Cell-free systems are dependent on the presence of messenger RNA (mRNA) for activity and may be used for the translation of messenger with some fidelity as witnessed by the in vitro synthesis of coat and other viral proteins under the direction of phage RNA. They are also used in translating synthetic polyribonucleotides. This has made possible the deciphering of the genetic code, i .e. the assignment of nucleotide triplets (codons) to all the amino acids, and has brought light to other features of messenger translation such as the direction of reading and the mechanism of polypeptide chain initiation, elongation and termination. I t is with these aspects of translation that this lecture will be mainly concerned. For a more complete survey of the literature prior to t966 the reader is referred to the excellent reviews by SINGER and L~DER [71] and SCt~WEE, and HEINTZ [69]. Disintegration of cells in aqueous media yields extracts containing the components of protein biosynthesis. As indicated in Fig. t for E. coli extracts the supernatant contains the energy sources (ATP, GTP), the amino acid transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and the aminoacyl~-~tRNA synthetases, along with certain proteins concerned with elongation of the polypeptide chains (factors T and G) and chain termination. Washing of the ribosomes with ammonium chloride solutions removes protein factors concerned with chain initiation. Although active cell-free systems of protein synthesis can be prepared from a variety of cells (animal, plant, bacterial), two kinds of cells have mostly been used in studies of the mechanism of protein biosynthesis and the genetic code, rabbit reticuloeytes and E. coli cells. The latter contain an endonuclease (ribonuclease I) which upon disintegration of the cells becomes associated with the ribosomes, and an exonuclease (ribonuclease II) present in the supernatant. Since these nucleases can degrade mRNA, their presence is clearly undesirable. Ribonuclease I can be avoided by the use of E. cdi mutants (such as Q 13 or MRE 600) which are almost free of this nuclease, but no convenient mutants lacking ribonuclease II are available. It was found in our laboratory that extracts of L. arabinosus are virtually free",1967,83,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We describe an application of this idea to an important inverse kinematics problem in structural biology: the loop closure problem. We have developed an algorithm for generating the conformations of candidate loops that fit in a gap of given length in a protein structure framework. Our method proceeds by concatenating small fragments of protein chosen from small libraries of representative fragments. Our approach has the advantages of ab initio methods since we are able to enumerate all candidate loops in the discrete approximation of the conformational space accessible to the loop, as well as the advantages of database search approach since the use of fragments of known protein structures guarantees that the backbone conformations are physically reasonable. We test our approach on a set of 427 loops, varying in length from four residues to 14 residues. The quality of the candidate loops is evaluated in terms of global coordinate root mean square (cRMS). The top predictions vary between 0.3 and 4.2 Å for four-residue loops and between 1.5 and 3.1 Å for 14-residue loops, respectively.",2005,80,83,3,4,3,3,6,9,6,6,14,7,6
553dbec48e4240e98aa00f19f780184722f8e202,Prediction of distant metastasis in follicular adenocarcinoma of the thyroid,"AbstractFollicular adenocarcinoma of the thyroid sometimes displays distant metastasis in spite of its low histological grade of malignancy. We have studied whether distant metastasis can be detected by the presence of blood vessel invasion. We have also examined the problem from the viewpoint of cell-to-cell conjugation.
This study examined 160 cases of follicular adenocarcinoma of the thyroid. Histological specimens were made by sectioning tumors at their largest diameter. Blood vessel endothelia were specifically stained immunohistochemically with factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europeaus agglutinin I (UEA-1). Then, the presence of blood vessel invasion was examined in detail. Furthermore, the conjugation of lectin-derived wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to tumor cells was examined. Conjugation of tumor cells was also examined using sialic acid as a marker.
Blood vessel invasion was recognized in 95 (59.4%) of 160 cases. Distant metastases were identified in 25 cases (15.6%) in which blood vessel invasion was also found. Relative to the group without distant metastases, the group with distant metastases showed not only a significantly higher sialic acid content but also higher levels of WGA-binding protein in the tissues. The risk of distant metastasis in patients with follicular adenocarcinoma of the thyroid appears to be related both to the extent and to the frequency of blood vessel invasion. Furthermore, assessment of the conjugation of cells appears to have predictive value for occurrence of distant metastases.RésuméL'adénocarcinome folliculaire de la thyroïde présente parfois des métastases à distance malgré son faible degré histologique de malignité.

Además, se estudió la conjugación de la aglutinina derivada del germen de trigo con las células tumorales; también se estudió la conjugación celular utilizando ácido siálico como marcador.Se identificó invasión vascular en 95 (59.4%) de los 160 casos. Se identificaron metástasis en 25 casos (15.6%) en los cuales también se hallo invasión vascular. En comparación con el grupo libre de metástăsis, el grupo con metástasis distantes exhibió no sólo un contenido de ácido siálico significativamente mayor, sino también un mayor nivel de proteína ligadora de la aglutinina del germen de trigo en los tejidos. El riesgo de metástasis en pacientes con adenocarcinoma folicular de la glándula tiroides parece estar correlacionado tanto con el grado como con la frecuencia de invasión vascular.

Incubation of soluble guanylate cyclase with nitroprusside and [35S]cystine resulted in a twofold increase in protein-bound radioactivity compared to incubations in the absence of nitroprusside. Purified enzyme preincubated with nitroprusside and then gel filtered (activated enzyme) was activated 10- to 20-fold compared to guanylate cyclase preincubated in the absence of nitroprusside and similarly processed (nonactivated enzyme). This activation was completely reversed by subsequent incubation at 37 degrees C (activation-reversed enzyme). Incorporation of [35S]cystine into guanylate cyclase was increased twofold with activated enzyme, while no difference was observed with activation-reversed enzyme, compared to nonactivated enzyme. Cystine decreased the activity of nonactivated and activation-reversed enzyme about 40% while it completely inhibited activated guanylate cyclase. Mg+2- or Mn+2-GTP inhibited the incorporation of [35S]cystine into nonactivated or activated guanylate cyclase. Also, diamide, a potent thiol oxidant that converts juxtaposed sulfhydryls to disulfides, completely blocked incorporation of [35S]cystine into nonactivated or activated guanylate cyclase. These data indicate that activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by nitroprusside results in an increased availability of protein sulfhydryl groups for mixed disulfide formation with cystine. Protection against mixed disulfide formation with diamide or substrate suggests that these groups exist as two or more juxtaposed sulfhydryl groups at the active site or a site on the enzyme that regulates catalytic activity. Differential inhibition by mixed disulfide formation of nonactivated and activated enzyme suggests a mechanism for amplification of the on-off signal for soluble guanylate cyclase within cells.",1986,22,46,0,0,1,1,2,0,4,2,0,1,4

A novel class of pulse sequences (S-AMCP) that employ an amplitude-modulated spin-lock field on the S -spin channel only and cw irradiation on the I -spin channel is introduced. It leads to efficient cross polarization at the standard Hartmann-Hahn condition while maintaining good spin-lock properties. S-AMCP does, however, not decrease the sensitivity to exact Hartmann-Hahn matching that can become critical under fast rotation. A double amplitude modulation scheme (D-AMCP) that uses amplitude modulation on both radiofrequency channels and significantly broadens the Hartmann-Hahn matching condition is presented. It can, however, be applied only to spin systems with relatively low I -spin homonuclear dipolar interactions due to the absence of an effective spin-locking field. S-AMCP pulse sequences, in contrast, are generally applicable and yield cross-polarization efficiencies that are always better than or equal to the standard continuous-wave cross-polarization experiment.",1993,10,82,0,0,5,4,3,4,4,5,5,4,4

The incorporation of expressed actin-GFP monomers into endogenous actin polymers enables energy migration FRET (emFRET, or homoFRET) between neighboring actin-GFPs. This energy migration reduces the normally high polarization of the GFP fluorescence. We derive a simple relationship between the actin-GFP fluorescence polarization anisotropy and the actin polymer fraction, thereby enabling a robust means of imaging the actin polymerization state with high spatiotemporal resolution and providing what to the best of our knowledge are the first direct images of the actin polymerization state in live, adult brain tissue and live, intact Drosophila larvae.",2012,42,34,1,1,2,9,4,5,2,3,4,4,0

Current details of how the enzyme works and other features governing its reaction are reviewed elsewhere (1–3). RNase P is responsible for generating the mature 5 -end of tRNAs by a single endonucleolytic cleavage of their precursors. It is an essential, ubiquitous enzyme present in all cells and cellular compartments that synthesize tRNA: bacterial cells, eukaryotic nuclei, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. The essential function in vivo of RNase P has been demonstrated in those systems amenable to genetic analysis such as bacteria (4) and yeast nuclei (5) and mitochondria (6, 7). All known RNase P enzymes are ribonucleoproteins and contain an RNA subunit essential for catalysis with the possible exception of RNase P in some plant chloroplasts and trypanosome mitochondria (8, 9). The chemical mechanism of RNase P involves essential divalent metal ions (2) and is thought to be an in-line SN2 displacement reaction (1). The endonucleolytic cleavage generates 5 -phosphate and 3 -hydroxyl end groups in the products. For our purposes, the way in which the enzyme recognizes substrates is an important feature of its ability to lower the amount of any particular RNA and expression inside cells. Natural substrates can be reduced to two oligonucleotides, which when hydrogen bonded together (Fig. 1) resemble sufficiently the essential features of a substrate so that one of the oligonucleotides, the target RNA (i.e. any RNA inside the cell), is cleaved efficiently by the enzyme and inactivated. This important aspect of RNase P revolves entirely around its substrate recognition mechanism and does not depend on the fact that there is an RNA subunit in the enzyme.",2002,65,99,4,1,8,9,8,8,14,6,3,8,2

Here, we focus this search on the sensory and motor neurons of bilaterians, exploiting their well-defined molecular signatures in vertebrates. Sensorimotor circuits in vertebrates are of two types: somatic (that sense the environment and respond by shaping bodily motions) and visceral (that sense the interior milieu and respond by regulating vital functions). These circuits differ by a small set of largely dedicated transcriptional determinants: Brn3 is expressed in many somatic sensory neurons, first and second order (among which mechanoreceptors are uniquely marked by the Brn3+/Islet1+/Drgx+ signature), somatic motoneurons uniquely co-express Lhx3/4 and Mnx1, while the vast majority of neurons, sensory and motor, involved in respiration, blood circulation or digestion are molecularly defined by their expression and dependence on the pan-visceral determinant Phox2b.ResultsWe explore the status of the sensorimotor transcriptional code of vertebrates in mollusks, a lophotrochozoa clade that provides a rich repertoire of physiologically identified neurons. In the gastropods Lymnaea stagnalis and Aplysia californica, we show that homologues of Brn3, Drgx, Islet1, Mnx1, Lhx3/4 and Phox2b differentially mark neurons with mechanoreceptive, locomotory and cardiorespiratory functions. Moreover, in the cephalopod Sepia officinalis, we show that Phox2 marks the stellate ganglion (in line with the respiratory — that is, visceral— ancestral role of the mantle, its target organ), while the anterior pedal ganglion, which controls the prehensile and locomotory arms, expresses Mnx.ConclusionsDespite considerable divergence in overall neural architecture, a molecular underpinning for the functional allocation of neurons to interactions with the environment or to homeostasis was inherited from the urbilaterian ancestor by contemporary protostomes and deuterostomes.",2013,68,43,6,1,4,5,5,9,6,3,5,5,0

Such experiments should help to define the extent of antibody diversity encoded as stable information in the genome and the corresponding importance of diversification. We report here that the hybridization pattern of a 13 S mRNA fraction, which contains L-chain mRNA (the LE fraction), consists of components which hybridize with repetitive and with non-repetitive elements in the DNA. A similar biphasic pattern is also shown to occur with a mRNA fraction prepared from mouse fibroblasts (which do not contain immunoglobulin mRNA) and a mRNA fraction from the nonmembrane bound polysomes of myeloma cells.

This lay on a well-worn path of biophysical analysis, reducing microscopic anatomy to the molecular level. It also helped inspire an enormous body of biochemical research that has defined DNA as the informational molecule, a discontinuity that has been labeled the Biological Revolution of the 20th Century. As a piece of structural analysis, the idea of the double helix includes the concepts (1) that DNA is a duplex structure, comprising two paired complementary strands, associated by secondary, noncovalent bonds; (2) that the strand pairs are coiled, forming a double helix; and (3) that these are antiparallel—the orientation of one strand being in the opposite polarity from the other.

If developed, a breath-based lipid test would greatly simplify management of diabetes and serious pathological conditions (e.g., obesity, familial hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease), in which systemic lipid levels are a critical risk factor for onset and development of future cardiovascular events. Methods: We, therefore, induced controlled fluctuations of plasma lipids (insulin-induced lipid suppression or intravenous infusion of Intralipid) during 4-h in vivo experiments on 23 healthy volunteers (12 males/11 females, 28.0 ± 0.3 years) to find correlations between exhaled volatile organic compounds and plasma lipids. In each subject, plasma triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acids (FFA) concentrations were both directly measured and calculated via individualized prediction equations based on the multiple linear regression analysis of a cluster of 4 gases. In the lipid infusion protocol, we also generated common prediction equations using a maximum of 10 gases. Results: This analysis yielded strong correlations between measured and predicted values during both lipid suppression (r = 0.97 for TG; r = 0.90 for FFA) and lipid infusion (r = 0.97 for TG; r = 0.94 for FFA) studies. In our most accurate common prediction model, measured and predicted TG and FFA values also displayed very strong statistical agreement (r = 0.86 and r = 0.81, respectively). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of measuring plasma lipids through breath analysis. Optimization of this technology may ultimately lead to the development of portable breath analyzers for plasma lipids, replacing blood-based bioassays.",2012,36,13,2,1,2,1,2,1,3,0,0,1,2

We investigated the degree of improvement in dark energy constraints that can be achieved by extending Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples to redshifts z > 1:5 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), particularly in the ongoing Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) multi-cycle treasury programs. Methods. Using the popular Chevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy w = w0 + wa(1 a) we generated mock SN Ia samples that can be projected out to higher redshifts. The synthetic datasets thus generated were fitted to the CPL model, and we evaluated the improvements that a high-z sample can add to improve the statistical and systematic uncertainties on cosmological parameters. Results. In an optimistic but still very achievable scenario, we find that extending the HST sample beyond CANDELS+CLASH to reach a total of 28 SN Ia at z > 1:0 could improve the uncertainty in the wa parameter wa by up to 21%. The corresponding improvement in the figure of merit (FoM) would be as high as 28%. Finally, we consider the use of high-redshift SN Ia samples to detect non-cosmological evolution in SN Ia luminosities with redshift, finding that these tests could be undertaken by future space-based infrared surveys using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).",2013,62,13,1,5,0,2,3,1,0,2,0,0,0

Among these is the armadillo gene, whose product seems to be required for the reception of an intercellular signal encoded by the wingless gene. As part of our effort to relate the structure of the armadillo protein to its function within the cell, we have examined the evolutionary conservation of the armadillo gene during insect evolution. We have cloned the armadillo gene from the housefly, Musca domestica, which diverged from Drosophila 100 million years ago. The Musca protein is 97.5% identical to that in Drosophila, while the noncoding sequences have diverged extensively. This remarkable degree of conservation at the protein level is mirrored in the expression pattern of the armadillo protein. Antibodies against the Drosophila protein cross-react with a Musca protein of the appropriate size. We have also used these antibodies to show that the Musca armadillo protein has a pattern of expression in larval and adult tissues similar to that of Drosophila armadillo. We discuss the implications of conservation of structure and expression for the cellular role of the armadillo protein and its mammalian homologs.",1993,49,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In contrast, in the sample of largest d, electronic transport is anisotropic in both crystallographic directions.

Based on data obtained by the use of structural analogs of the SRS-A LTs and of LTB4, we have recently determined a number of the structural bases for the biological function of each moiety. With regard to the SRS-A leukotrienes, analogs differed from the native structures in the position of the peptide side chain and/or the hydroxyl group, the number and position of ethylenic bonds, the chirality at optically-active centers, or the structures of the four polar substituents in the C-1 to C-6 region. Analogs of LTB4, differing in the stereochemistry of their ethylenic bonds, were evaluated for chemotactic activity both in vitro, using human neutrophils, and in vivo intracutaneously in the rhesus monkey. We propose that true receptors exist on the pulmonary parenchyma of the guinea pig for the SRS-A LTs and on the primate neutrophil for LTB4. Further, LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 have been shown to elicit a wheal and prolonged flare in human skin, whereas LTB4 evokes a time-dependent induration. The interaction of these secondary mediators may be critical to a fully developed host inflammatory response to both immunologic and non-immunologic injury.",1982,23,31,0,1,2,5,6,1,1,2,4,4,1

These effects can be attributed either to the modification of bilayer properties (thickness, curvature and surface tension) or to the binding of specific lipids to the protein surface. For G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the effects of phospholipids on receptor structure and activity remain poorly understood. Here we reconstituted purified β2-adrenergic receptor (β2R) in high-density lipoparticles to systematically characterize the effect of biologically relevant phospholipids on receptor activity. We observed that the lipid headgroup type affected ligand binding (agonist and antagonist) and receptor activation. Specifically, phosphatidylgycerol markedly favored agonist binding and facilitated receptor activation, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine favored antagonist binding and stabilized the inactive state of the receptor. We then showed that these effects could be recapitulated with detergent-solubilized lipids, demonstrating that the functional modulation occurred in the absence of a bilayer. Our data suggest that phospholipids act as direct allosteric modulators of GPCR activity.",2016,41,190,4,21,32,34,32,39,32,0,0,0,0

f01e7d1c6872d466dee1da4d77491d0bc6bdca97,Electron Coupled Interactions between Nuclear Spins in Molecules,"In addition to the direct magnetic interaction between two nuclear spins in a molecule, the nuclei can have an effective mutual interaction as a result of the magnetic interactions between each of the nuclei and the electrons of the molecule. Although these indirect interactions are in general small, they are important in many cases, particularly as a result of the fact that the frequent collisions which characterize most nuclear paramagnetic resonance experiments cause the direct interaction to average to zero while this is not so for the indirect. In the present paper, the indirect interactions are evaluated. Contributions arise from a simple diamagnetic term, a closely related second-order orbital paramagnetism term, and terms due to the magnetic interaction of the nuclei with the electron spins. Expressions for each of these terms are given both for the general case and for the spherically symmetric case which arises when there are many collisions. Specific numerical calculations of the various effects are given for hydrogen deuteride. It is shown for HD that the diamagnetic terms are of the order of a few tenths of a cycle per second. On the other hand, if the suitable mean energy of the molecular excited states is given the reasonable value of 1.4 Rydbergs, the electron spin terms are 43 cps in agreement with experiment.",1953,0,664,2,0,2,3,7,4,6,6,9,9,11

f370bb34630913cf549f5dcf674e60fab2d32fed,"The PtdIns(3,4)P2 phosphatase INPP4A is a suppressor of excitotoxic neuronal death","Phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol, collectively referred to as phosphoinositides, occur in the cytoplasmic leaflet of cellular membranes and regulate activities such as vesicle transport, cytoskeletal reorganization and signal transduction. Recent studies have indicated an important role for phosphoinositide metabolism in the aetiology of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, myopathy and inflammation. Although the biological functions of the phosphatases that regulate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) have been well characterized, little is known about the functions of the phosphatases regulating the closely related molecule phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2). Here we show that inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 4A (INPP4A), a PtdIns(3,4)P2 phosphatase, is a suppressor of glutamate excitotoxicity in the central nervous system. Targeted disruption of the Inpp4a gene in mice leads to neurodegeneration in the striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia that has a central role in motor and cognitive behaviours. Notably, Inpp4a-/- mice show severe involuntary movement disorders. In vitro, Inpp4a gene silencing via short hairpin RNA renders cultured primary striatal neurons vulnerable to cell death mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Mechanistically, INPP4A is found at the postsynaptic density and regulates synaptic NMDAR localization and NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current. Thus, INPP4A protects neurons from excitotoxic cell death and thereby maintains the functional integrity of the brain. Our study demonstrates that PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and the phosphatases acting on them can have distinct regulatory roles, and provides insight into the unique aspects and physiological significance of PtdIns(3,4)P2 metabolism. INPP4A represents, to our knowledge, the first signalling protein with a function in neurons to suppress excitotoxic cell death. The discovery of a direct link between PtdIns(3,4)P2 metabolism and the regulation of neurodegeneration and involuntary movements may aid the development of new approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",2010,50,98,4,2,9,13,20,8,13,11,3,4,10

17a4798be883e8f821643a0aa46a9c66925083fc,Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins,"In neural systems, information is often carried by ensembles of cells rather than by individual units. Optical indicators provide a powerful means to reveal such distributed activity, particularly when protein-based and encodable in DNA: encodable probes can be introduced into cells, tissues, or transgenic organisms by genetic manipulation, selectively expressed in anatomically or functionally defined groups of cells, and, ideally, recorded in situ, without a requirement for exogenous cofactors. Here we describe sensors for secretion and neurotransmission that fulfil these criteria. We have developed pH-sensitive mutants of green fluorescent protein (‘pHluorins’) by structure-directed combinatorial mutagenesis, with the aim of exploiting the acidic pH inside secretory vesicles, to monitor vesicle exocytosis and recycling. When linked to a vesicle membrane protein, pHluorins were sorted to secretory and synaptic vesicles and reported transmission at individual synaptic boutons, as well as secretion and fusion pore ‘flicker’ of single secretory granules.",1998,29,2279,215,4,20,24,31,37,41,70,60,70,73

Hv channels are unusual compared to voltage-dependent K(+), Na(+), and Ca(2+) channels in that Hv channel genes encode a voltage sensor domain (VSD) without a pore domain. The H(+) currents observed when Hv channels are expressed heterologously suggest that the VSD itself provides the pathway for proton conduction. In order to exclude the possibility that the Hv channel VSD assembles with an as yet unknown protein in the cell membrane as a requirement for H(+) conduction, we have purified Hv channels to homogeneity and reconstituted them into synthetic lipid liposomes. The Hv channel VSD by itself supports H(+) flux.",2009,18,94,2,5,9,3,14,9,9,14,7,4,5

Transcription factors that act on RNA polymerase in elongation mode potentially influence this mode of repair. Previously, it was shown that transcription elongation factors TFIIS and Cockayne’s syndrome complementation group B protein did not disrupt the ternary complex of RNA polymerase II stalled at a thymine cyclobutane dimer, nor did they enable RNA polymerase II to bypass the dimer. Here we investigated the effect of the transcription factor 2 on RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase I stalled at thymine dimers. Transcription factor 2 is known to release transcripts from RNA polymerase II early elongation complex generated by pulse-transcription. We found that factor 2 (which is also called release factor) disrupts the ternary complex of RNA polymerase II at a thymine dimer and surprisingly exerts the same effect on RNA polymerase I. These findings show that in mammalian cells a RNA polymerase I or RNA polymerase II transcript truncated by a lesion in the template strand may be discarded unless repair is accomplished rapidly by a mechanism that does not displace stalled RNA polymerases.",1999,48,48,1,0,0,2,5,10,5,5,6,1,1

The holes were formed electrochemically by applying short negative voltage pulses to the STM tip prior to Cu deposition. The lateral extension of the clusters is confined by the width of the holes. Their equilibrium height depends on the applied overpotential rather than on the polarization time, reflecting a delicate energy balance between the electrochemical energy and the enlarged surface energy of the growing Cu cluster. We attributed this to the formation of steps at the size-confined Cu islands and derived a step formation energy of 0.4–0.5 eV/(step atom). This is in good agreement with expectations for the formation energy of kinky steps on metal surfaces.",1999,37,29,0,0,5,3,5,3,1,1,1,1,1
13a40a6bfbd390d9e578f948fa8370060c664240,Study design for a hepatitis B vaccine trial.,"A short-time trial of small sample size for an evaluation of the hepatitis B vaccine is proposed and designed. The vaccine is based on the premise that antibody to the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus is protective against viral infection. This premise is verified by using the presence of the surface antigen as the marker of infection and comparing infection rates in renal dialysis patients who had naturally acquired antibody to patients without antibody. Patients with antibody have an extremely low risk of infection. The probability of remaining uninfected decreases at an exponential rate for patients without antibody, implying a constant risk of infection at any point in time. The study design described makes use of this time independence and the observed infection rates to formulate a clinical trial which can be accomplished with a relatively small number of patients. This design might be useful if, in preliminary studies, it is shown that the vaccine produces antibody in the patients and that protection against hepatitis B virus would be beneficial to the patients.",1976,0,11,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The role of the host genotype in parental leads to F1 radiation chimeras in the control of the specificity of cytolytic T-lymphocyte responses to trinitrophenyl-modified syngeneic cells,"Bone marrow cells from C3H (H-2k) mice, a strain that does not exhibit cross-reactive lysis of trinitrophenyl (TNP)-modified allogeneic targets, were allowed to mature in heavily irradiated (B6 times C3H)F1 (H-2b/k) recipients, an F1 hybrid that does demonstrate cross-reactive lysis. Spleen cells from these chimeric mice were removed after 3-4 mo and by H-2 typing shown to be of C3H origin. These cells were found to be tolerant to B6 alloantigens by mixed lymphocyte reaction and cell- mediated cytotoxicity and, when stimulated in vitro with TNP-modified syngeneic cells, now cross-reactively lysed TNP-modified allogeneic targets. These studies demonstrate that the host environment where T cells differentiate influences the specificity of the primary cytolytic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response to TNP-modified syngeneic antigens.",1978,17,26,0,3,5,7,4,2,2,0,0,1,0

The extracts, like the OMV, nullified the effect of antiserum raised against whole BS4 (agar) to promote intracellular killing of the latter by human peripheral blood phagocytes. Fractionation of the extract on Sephadex G75 produced an active fraction with much less protein and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) than in the original extract. Furthermore, crude LPS prepared from the resistant gonococci was inactive. These results imply that the factor(s) promoting intracellular resistance is a protein. SDS-PAGE of the active fraction suggested that the factor was not a principal outer membrane protein nor one of three proteins previously thought to be associated with resistance. In contrast to a similar preparation from a phagocyte-susceptible strain, BSSH, the active fraction from BS4 (agar) showed faintly staining proteins in the regions of 20 and 60 kDal. When eluted from the gels, the former but not the latter neutralized the above effect of antisera, thus associating the 20 kDal protein(s) with resistance to intracellular killing.",1985,18,13,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,3,0,2

We describe the calibration of this instrument, including the method of obtaining calibration data, reduction of data, the instrument model, fitting the model to the calibration data, and application of the resulting model solution to sky observations. The instrument model fits well for calibration data that resemble sky condition. The method of propagating detector noise through the calibration process to yield a covariance matrix of the calibrated sky data is described. The final uncertainties are variable both in frequency and position, but for a typical calibrated sky 2.6 deg square pixel and 0.7/cm spectral element the random detector noise limit is of order of a few times 10(exp -7) ergs/sq cm/s/sr cm for 2-20/cm, and the difference between the sky and the best-fit cosmic blackbody can be measured with a gain uncertainty of less than 3%.",1994,0,74,6,0,4,5,4,4,4,1,2,1,1

The energy, the concentration of double occupied sites, the kinetic energy and the chemical potential of the ground state are in a good numerical agreement with the exact results over a wide range of parameters U/t and n. The concentration of local pairs or double occupied sites in the Bethe-ansatz solution serves as a suitable parameter measuring the electron pairing correlations. The SCF theory provides a simple analytical relationship between the concentration of double occupied sites, the band filling and the BCS order parameter, valid for arbitrary U/t and n. The calculated energy gap, the BCS order parameter, the phase diagram and the compressibility are also discussed.

Nuclear transfer and cell fusion can lead to efficient reprogramming of gene expression. The egg and oocyte reprogramming process includes the exchange of somatic proteins for oocyte proteins, the post-translational modification of histones and the demethylation of DNA.

In addition, it has no sequence homology with the previously characterized follicular fluid inhibins, which are heterodimeric proteins of Mr 32,000 with follicle-stimulating hormone release-inhibiting activity. This protein specifically inhibits the basal secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone, but not that of luteinizing hormone, in the rat anterior pituitary monolayer culture system with a half-maximal effective dose of 2.5-6.0 ng/ml.

The enzyme was reacted with [14C]acetyl-CoA or [14C]iodoacetamide. 14C-Labeled enzyme was digested with pepsin, trypsin or both. 14C-Labeled peptides were isolated by several purification procedures. The amino acid sequence of the active site of condensing enzyme was determined to be Tyr-Gln-Val-Glu-Ser-Cys-Pro-Ile-Leu-Glu-Gly-Lys and that of acetyl transferase was Phe-Ser-Gly-Ala-Thr-Gly-His-Ser-Gln-Gly. The amino acid composition around the 4'-phosphopantetheine-carrying serine was determined to be Asx2, Thr, Ser, Glx3, Gly2, Ala, Ile, Leu3, and Lys. When these active-site peptides were compared with those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae synthetase, a high degree of homology was observed in the active-site peptides of the acetyl transferase and acyl carrier protein domains.

e42a1208eaa35383195be7fa04e19f0dfe08515a,B. Chromosomes and genes - Fine structure of chromosomes,"Mendel discovered the particulate nature of hereditary factors and the rules of their transmission without knowledge of chromosomes. Indeed, much of the classical knowledge of heredity was obtained without reference to any cell structure. When, in the 1920’s, chromosomes were established as the carriers of the linear order of genes, many questions beyond the formal analysis of order and transmission could be tackled. Structural analysis, it was hoped, would soon reveal the mechanism of genetic crossing-over and chromosome replication and chemical studies of chromosomes were expected to give information on the nature of the gene. It turned out, however, that the light microscope could not reveal the organization of chromosomes and that their chemical nature was so complex that it prevented the recognition of the substance of the gene. Progress in chemical genetics became possible only after genetic analysis was extended to viruses and bacteria, organisms which do not have true chromosomes but a much simpler genetic system. Now DNA, already suspected of having something to do with the gene because of its constant association with chromosomes, could be established as the molecular basis of heredity. Above all, it was the recognition of the molecular structure of DNA which provided the understanding of the nature of genetic specificity and its expression in cellular synthesis, and suggested mechanisms for its replication. Viruses and bacteria provided the ideal material for analysis of the basic properties of a genetic system since here the genome consists of a single DNA molecule. It has been recognized for some time that bacteria and the related blue-green algae possess an unusual nuclear organization. The term prokaryotes has been used to distinguish these organisms, from the eukaryote animal and plant cells with typical chromosomes and mitotic division (Dougherty 1957; Ris & Chandler 1963). These terms are useful since they stress a real difference in the complexity of the genetic systems of the two cell types. How has the knowledge gained from the study of micro-organisms helped us in understanding the chromosome? It appears that the basic properties of the genetic system such as the coding for amino acids by the nucleotide sequence of the DNA and its transcription into RNA are alike in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Nevertheless, the great difference in structural complexity of the two kinds of nuclei must signify some interesting modifications in their operations. It seems to me Important that this difference be recognized in terminology. Since the term chromosome' has been applied to the complex nucleoprotein structure of the ekaryote nucleus, it is unwise to use it also for the DNA molecule of viruses or cteria. I have, therefore, suggested ‘genophore’ as a general term to designate e physical counterpart of a linkage group (Ris 1961). How does a chromosome ffer from the genophore of a bacterial cell? From chemical studies, we know at in addition to DNA a chromosome contains considerable amounts of protein, particularly basic proteins of relatively small molecular weight (histones). In most nuclei, more complex proteins are also associated with chromosomes in variable amounts. What are the roles of these proteins? The chromosome complement of mammals contains about a thousand times as much DNA as a bacterial genophore. Does the histone serve to reversibly coil and condense the long DNA read into a manageable form? It has been suggested that histones act to repress ecific genes. What controls their specific association with DNA and how does is affect chromosome structure? In the light microscope, the chromosome appears ultistranded, and yet during replication it seems to behave in a semi-concervative manner analogous to a single DNA molecule. How can the DNA in a chromosome replicate in the same way as a bacterial genophore since it is many mes longer and in a complex association with protein? Obviously, before we can understand the basic processes of chromosomes, such as their replication and conformational changes during activation of RNA synthesis, we must have a clear understanding of chromosome organization at the molecular level. When the ectron microscope began to reveal the fine structure of cytoplasmic organelles, was hoped that it would soon solve the problems of chromosome organization. While it has shown some interesting details, we must admit that it has not yet answered any of the basic questions. As Porter said some years ago: ‘The nucleus both during interphase and mitosis has come to be regarded as one of the most difficult of biological objects to study by methods of electron microscopy' (Porter 1960). Other methods such as X-ray diffraction and polarizing microscopy have also offered promise here or there without giving final answers to the basic questions. Even though it is as yet impossible to propose a satisfactory model for the chromosome, it might prove useful to review what sort of structures have been revealed by these techniques, how these structures might be related to chromosome function, and what major problems remain unsolved.",1966,0,42,0,0,5,6,2,4,5,2,3,2,0

They endow cells with polarity, shape, and structure, and their extensive surface area provides substrates for intracellular trafficking and scaffolds for signaling molecules. Consequently, microtubule polymerization dynamics affect not only structural features of the cell but also the subcellular localization of proteins that can trigger intracellular signaling events. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the processes of touch receptor neurons are filled with a bundle of specialized large-diameter microtubules. We find that conditions that disrupt these microtubules (loss of either the MEC-7 β-tubulin or MEC-12 α-tubulin or growth in 1 mM colchicine) cause a general reduction in touch receptor neuron (TRN) protein levels. This reduction requires a p38 MAPK pathway (DLK-1, MKK-4, and PMK-3) and the transcription factor CEBP-1.

Testicular weight was also significantly decreased by these treatments while plasma testosterone levels were decreased by treatment with the LHRH agonist and increased after hCG. A single injection of the LHRH agonist or hCG also induced a long-lasting loss of testis LH binding sites with receptor levels returning to control values at 8 days. These findings indicate than an elevation of endogenous LH, whether induced by single or repeated injection of a potent LHRH agonist, is capable of down regulating testicular LH receptors with a resultant long-term effect of reduced testicular size and decreased plasma testosterone concentration.",1977,11,177,0,0,16,17,24,20,18,9,24,6,1

CO activates cGMP and has a direct effect on potassium channels. Both actions of CO lead to hyperpolarization of a cell's resting membrane potential, suggesting that CO may function as a hyperpolarizing factor, although direct evidence is still lacking. Here we take advantage of the known membrane potential gradient that exists in the muscle layers of the gastrointestinal tract to determine whether CO is an endogenous hyperpolarizing factor. We find that heme oxygenase-2-null mice have depolarized smooth muscle cells and that the membrane potential gradient in the gut is abolished. Exogenous CO hyperpolarizes the membrane potential. Regions of the canine gastrointestinal tract that are more hyperpolarized generate more CO and have higher heme oxygenase activity than more depolarized regions. Our results suggest that CO is a critical hyperpolarizing factor required for the maintenance of intestinal smooth muscle membrane potential and gradient.",2003,26,87,2,0,4,3,3,10,6,6,9,1,2

Odorants are initially detected by odorant receptors (ORs) on olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the nose. In the mouse, each OSN expresses one of ∼1000 different OR genes. Although OSNs and their expressed ORs constitute the fundamental units of sensory input to the brain, a comprehensive understanding of how they encode odor identities is still lacking. To gain a broader and more detailed understanding of odorant recognition and odor coding at this level, we tested the responses of 3000 mouse OSNs to 125 odorants with diverse structures and perceived odors. These studies revealed extraordinary diversity, but also bias, in odorant recognition by the OSN, and thus OR, repertoire. They indicate that most OSNs are narrowly tuned to detect a subset of odorants with related structures and often related odors, but that the repertoire also includes broadly tuned components. Strikingly, the vast majority of odorants activated a unique set of OSNs, usually two or more in combination. The resulting combinatorial codes varied in size among odorants and sometimes contained both narrowly and broadly tuned components. While many OSNs recognized multiple odorants, some appeared specific for a given pheromone or other animal-associated compound, or for one or more odorants with a particular odor quality, raising the possibility that signals derived from some OSNs and ORs might elicit an innate behavior or convey a specific odor quality.",2011,44,171,9,4,11,15,23,19,9,21,16,16,23

Recent experiments demonstrate that contributions to synaptic plasticity from different spike pairs within a spike train do not add linearly. In the visual cortex conditioning with spike triplets shows that the effect of the first spike pair dominates over the second. Using a previously proposed calcium-dependent plasticity model, we show that short-term synaptic dynamics and interaction between successive back-propagating action potentials (BPAP) may jointly account for the nonlinearities observed. Paired-pulse depression and attenuation of BPAPs are incorporated into the model through the use-dependent depletion of pre- and postsynaptic resources, respectively.

Ischemia/reperfusion injury associated with organ transplantation affects early graft function and acute rejection. Recently, it has been suggested that ischemic insult increases the immunogenicity of the organ. The purpose of this study was to determine the expression of a cell adhesion molecule, CD80, which plays an important role in the costimulatory pathway for full T-cell activation in organ transplantation.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Wistar male rats weighing 150-180 g were divided into control group and ischemia groups with temporary clamping of the left renal artery for 30, 60 and 180 minutes. The left kidneys obtained at 1 hour, 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after reperfusion were subjected to total RNA extraction followed by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), fluorescence immunostaining and histological staining.


RESULT
The expression of CD80 by RT-PCR was not observed in the control group, but was observed in the ischemia groups from 1 to 14 days after reperfusion. Fluorescence immunostaining of CD80 was positive in the ischemia groups, but not in the control group. CD80 expression was detected mainly in the endothelium of the glomeruli and the peritubular vessels.


CONCLUSION
These results indicate that CD80 is upregulated by ischemic insult, and that the costimulatory pathway may be enhanced by ischemia/reperfusion injury without alloantigens.",2002,17,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here we report that removal of the kinase complex TFIIK from TFIIH shifts the TSS in a yeast system upstream to the location observed in metazoans. Conversely, moving the normal TSS to an upstream location enables a high level of TFIIK-independent transcription in the yeast system. We distinguish two stages of the transcription initiation process: bubble formation by TFIIH, which fills the Pol II active center with single-stranded DNA, and subsequent scanning downstream, also driven by TFIIH, which requires displacement of the initial bubble.

The NMR structure of the 206-residue protein NP_346487.1 was determined with the J-UNIO protocol, which includes extensive automation of the structure determination. With input from three APSY-NMR experiments, UNIO-MATCH automatically yielded 77 % of the backbone assignments, which were interactively validated and extended to 97 %. With an input of the near-complete backbone assignments and three 3D heteronuclear-resolved [1H,1H]-NOESY spectra, automated side chain assignment with UNIO-ATNOS/ASCAN resulted in 77 % of the expected assignments, which was extended interactively to about 90 %. Automated NOE assignment and structure calculation with UNIO-ATNOS/CANDID in combination with CYANA was used for the structure determination of this two-domain protein. The individual domains in the NMR structure coincide closely with the crystal structure, and the NMR studies further imply that the two domains undergo restricted hinge motions relative to each other in solution. NP_346487.1 is so far the largest polypeptide chain to which the J-UNIO structure determination protocol has successfully been applied.

Twenty-three patients, 16 with pulmonary arterial PH, 7 with chronic thromboembolic PH, and with SDB defined as mean nocturnal oxygen saturation <90% or oxygen saturation dips >10 h(-1) with daytime PaO2 ≥7.3 kPa participated. Assessments at the end of the treatment periods included a 6 min walk distance (MWD), SF-36 quality of life, polysomnography, and echocardiography.


RESULTS
Medians (quartiles) of the 6 MWD after NOT, acetazolamide, and placebo were 480 m (390;528), 440 m (368;468), and 454 m (367;510), respectively, mean differences: NOT vs. placebo +25 m (95% CI 3-46, P= 0.027), acetazolamide vs. placebo -9 m (-34-17, P = 0.223), and NOT vs. acetazolamide +33 (12-45, P < 0.001). SF-36 quality of life was similar with all treatments. Nocturnal oxygen saturation significantly improved with both NOT and acetazolamide. Right ventricular fractional area change was greater on NOT compared with placebo (P = 0.042) and acetazolamide (P = 0.027).


CONCLUSIONS
In patients with pre-capillary PH and SDB on optimized pharmacological therapy, NOT improved the 6 MWD compared with placebo already after 1 week along with improvements in SDB and haemodynamics.

Using this building block, oligonucleotides bearing the phenanthridinium moiety as an artificial DNA base were prepared via automated solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry. The modified phenanthridinium-containing DNA duplexes were characterized by UV/vis absorption spectroscopy (including the melting behavior), CD spectroscopy, and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. These experiments reveal the expected similarity of the synthetic phenanthridinium moiety with noncovalently bound ethidium. More importantly, the results show clearly that the artificial phenanthridinium base is intercalated within the DNA base stack. The counterbase as part of the complementary strand seems to have only a minor influence on the intercalation properties of the phenanthridinium moiety.",2004,0,56,0,1,4,4,5,9,6,7,2,2,1

These methods seem to be applicable also to other lymphoid tissues. Preliminary studies, extended to nine of the acid hydrolases, indicate that these enzymes occur in partly latent and sedimentable form and that they can be unmasked and rendered soluble by some of the treatments that liberate the enzymes from rat-liver lysosomes. The spleen particles appear to be very sensitive to mechanical injury, a property which necessitates special precautions in homogenizing the tissue.

Shape switching and substrate binding in ion-controlled nanomechanical molecular tweezers.,"As examples of supramolecular devices performing chemical (ionic, molecular) control of binding events and models of related natural systems, two molecular conformational switches are described, which display cation-controlled nanomechanical motion coupled to substrate binding and release. The substrate binding relies on donor/acceptor interactions, provided by intercalation between planar sites located at the extremities of the switching units, whereas cation complexation is responsible for conformational regulation. The terpyridine py-py-py-based receptor is activated toward substrate binding upon complexation of a zinc(II) cation and operates in a two-state process. The replacement of the central pyridine by a 4,6-disubstituted pyridimine as in py-pym-py induces a state reversal and yields a new receptor which binds a substrate in the absence of cation, and releases it when copper(I) is introduced, following a three-step process. These systems represent effector-triggered supramolecular switching devices leading toward multistate nanomechanical chemical systems. These two systems illustrate the use of simple conformational switches in the binding site and allosteric regulation of substrate affinity.",2004,0,169,0,2,7,9,6,11,12,12,20,10,7

A hemodynamic load provokes rapid expression of the growth factor-inducible nuclear oncogene, c-fos, and certain peptide growth factors specifically stimulate the ""fetal"" cardiac genes associated with hypertrophy, even in the absence of load. These include the gene encoding vascular smooth muscle alpha-actin, the earliest alpha-actin expressed during cardiac myogenesis; however, it is not known whether reactivation of the smooth muscle alpha-actin gene occurs in ventricular hypertrophy. We therefore investigated myocardial expression of the smooth muscle alpha-actin gene after hemodynamic overload. Smooth muscle alpha-actin mRNA was discernible 24 h after coarctation and was persistently expressed for up to 30 d. In hypertrophied hearts, the prevalence of smooth muscle alpha-actin gene induction was 0.909, versus 0.545 for skeletal muscle alpha-actin (P less than 0.05). Ventricular mass after 2 d or more of aortic constriction was more highly correlated with smooth muscle alpha-actin gene activation (r = 0.852; P = 0.0001) than with skeletal muscle alpha-actin (r = 0.532; P = 0.009); P less than 0.0005 for the difference in the correlation coefficients. Thus, smooth muscle alpha-actin is a molecular marker of the presence and extent of pressure-overload hypertrophy, whose correlation with cardiac growth at least equals that of skeletal alpha-actin. Induction of smooth muscle alpha-actin was delayed and sustained after aortic constriction, whereas the nuclear oncogenes c-jun and junB were expressed rapidly and transiently, providing potential dimerization partners for transcriptional control by c-fos.",1991,38,122,3,1,8,6,2,3,8,7,6,5,5

The addition of the inducer, isopropyl-β- d -thiogalactoside, to either repressor or core does not produce a measurable structural change, since the radius of gyration of repressor is 40.3 ± 1.9 A without and 42.2 ± 1.7 A with isopropyl-β- d -thiogalactoside; the core radius of gyration is 35.4 ± 1.1 A without ligand and 36.3 ± 1.1 A with isopropyl-β- d -thiogalactoside. In the context of data from single crystals of repressor and core, the measured radii of gyration are shown to be consistent with a core (or repressor) molecule of dimensional anisotropy 1: (1.5 to 2.0): (3.0 to 4.0). The 5 A difference in radius of gyration between native and core repressor is interpreted to mean that the amino terminal 59 residues (headpieces) lie at the ends of an elongated repressor molecule. This structure implies that the repressor may have DNA binding sites, consisting of two adjacent headpieces, on each end of the molecule and this binds to the DNA with its long axis perpendicular to the DNA.",1982,17,36,1,1,3,2,1,0,2,1,1,2,2
47370068905f0adddfbbe9a5f799a410f1eb68ed,Renormalization of Massless Yang-Mills Fields,"The problem of renormalization of gauge fields is studied. It is observed that the use of non-gauge invariant regulator fields is not excluded provided that in the limit of high regulator mass gauge invariance can be restored by means of a finite number of counter-terms in the Lagrangian. Massless Yang-Mills fields can be treated in this manner, and appear to be renormalizable in the usual sense. 
 
Consistency of the method is proved for diagrams with non-overlapping divergencies by means of gauge invariant regulators, which however, cannot be interpreted in terms of regulator fields. Assuming consistency the S-matrix is shown to be unitary in any order of the coupling constant. A restriction must be made: no local, parity-changing transformations must be contained in the underlying gauge group. The interactions must conserve parity.",1971,12,767,10,1,11,14,20,16,10,15,16,23,17

A more recent development is the ability to fabricate artificial capillaries with nanometre dimensions, which has enabled new research on molecular transport and led to the emergence of nanofluidics. But surface roughness in particular makes it challenging to produce capillaries with precisely controlled dimensions at this spatial scale. Here we report the fabrication of narrow and smooth capillaries through van der Waals assembly, with atomically flat sheets at the top and bottom separated by spacers made of two-dimensional crystals with a precisely controlled number of layers. We use graphene and its multilayers as archetypal two-dimensional materials to demonstrate this technology, which produces structures that can be viewed as if individual atomic planes had been removed from a bulk crystal to leave behind flat voids of a height chosen with atomic-scale precision. Water transport through the channels, ranging in height from one to several dozen atomic planes, is characterized by unexpectedly fast flow (up to 1 metre per second) that we attribute to high capillary pressures (about 1,000 bar) and large slip lengths. For channels that accommodate only a few layers of water, the flow exhibits a marked enhancement that we associate with an increased structural order in nanoconfined water. Our work opens up an avenue to making capillaries and cavities with sizes tunable to ångström precision, and with permeation properties further controlled through a wide choice of atomically flat materials available for channel walls.",2016,53,291,2,3,31,53,56,76,70,1,0,0,0

Such a model is consistent with a structure similar to that of the reaction center of purple bacteria but with a reduced coupling of the chlorophyll special pair. We find that this model is consistent with many experimental studies of PS II. The similarity in magnitude of the exciton coupling and energetic disorder in PS II results in the exciton states being structurally highly heterogeneous. This model suggests that P680, the primary electron donor of PS II, should not be considered a dimer but a multimer of several weakly coupled pigments, including the pheophytin electron acceptor. We thus conclude that even if the reaction center of PS II is structurally similar to that of purple bacteria, its spectroscopy and primary photochemistry may be very different.",1995,0,193,10,6,10,5,12,7,3,6,10,8,13

Several short nucleotide sequences adjacent to the ORFs for the inhibited genes are similar and could be targets for transcriptional repression.

Patch-clamp recordings from cell-attached patches showed that serotonin, applied locally outside the patch, caused the opening of channels of approximately equal to 3 pS conductance and an average lifetime of approximately equal to 100 msec. The extrapolated reversal potential indicated that the channels are chloride-selective. Single-channel currents with similar characteristics were observed in inside-out patches from native oocytes in response to elevated calcium concentrations on the cytoplasmic side. Measurements of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) by fura-2 fluorescence showed approximately equal to 10-fold increases in [Ca2+]i in response to serotonin application in both normal and calcium-free Ringer solution in mRNA-injected oocytes. Little or no response to serotonin was observed in native oocytes. These results suggest that serotonin activation of receptors that are inserted into the oocyte membrane following injection of rat brain poly(A)+ mRNA can induce calcium release from intracellular stores. The increase in [Ca2+]i subsequently activates calcium-dependent chloride channels. Because calcium-dependent chloride channels and a receptor-controlled mechanism of internal calcium release have been shown to exist in native oocytes, we conclude that the newly inserted serotonin receptors utilized the endogenous second-messenger-mediated calcium release to activate endogenous calcium-dependent chloride channels.",1987,2,155,6,0,9,16,16,16,7,9,3,4,6

The waning responsiveness of GPCRs in the face of persistent agonist stimulation, or desensitization, is a necessary event that ensures physiological homeostasis. GPCR kinases (GRKs) are important regulators of GPCR desensitization. GRK5, one member of the GRK family, desensitizes central M(2) muscarinic receptors in mice. We questioned whether GRK5 might also be an important regulator of peripheral muscarinic receptor responsiveness in the cardiopulmonary system. Specifically, we wanted to determine the role of GRK5 in regulating muscarinic receptor-mediated control of airway smooth muscle tone or regulation of cholinergic-induced bradycardia. Tracheal pressure, heart rate, and tracheal smooth muscle tension were measured in mice having a targeted deletion of the GRK5 gene (GRK5(-/-)) and littermate wild-type (WT) control mice. Both in vivo and in vitro results showed that the airway contractile response to a muscarinic receptor agonist was not different between GRK5(-/-) and WT mice. However, the relaxation component of bilateral vagal stimulation and the airway smooth muscle relaxation resulting from beta(2)-adrenergic receptor activation were diminished in GRK5(-/-) mice. These data suggest that M(2) muscarinic receptor-mediated opposition of airway smooth muscle relaxation is regulated by GRK5 and is, therefore, excessive in GRK5(-/-) mice. In addition, this study shows that GRK5 regulates pulmonary responses in a tissue- and receptor-specific manner but does not regulate peripheral cardiac muscarinic receptors. GRK5 regulation of airway responses may have implications in obstructive airway diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",2004,45,62,2,3,5,2,8,4,8,3,6,3,3

b255fa7a33a023c85610ac621f69b76ec3e3105d,Poliovirus mutant that does not selectively inhibit host cell protein synthesis.,"A poliovirus type I (Mahoney strain) mutant was obtained by inserting three base pairs into an infectious cDNA clone. The extra amino acid encoded by the insertion was in the amino-terminal (protein 8) portion of the P2 segment of the polyprotein. The mutant virus makes small plaques on HeLa and monkey kidney (CV-1) cells at all temperatures. It lost the ability to mediate the selective inhibition of host cell translation which ordinarily occurs in the first few hours after infection. As an apparent consequence, the mutant synthesizes far less protein than does wild-type virus. In mutant-infected CV-1 cells enough protein was produced to permit a normal course of RNA replication, but the yield of progeny virus was very low. In mutant-infected HeLa cells there was a premature cessation of both cellular and viral protein synthesis followed by a premature halt of viral RNA synthesis. This nonspecific translational inhibition was distinguishable from wild-type-mediated inhibition and did not appear to be part of an interferon or heat shock response. Because the mutant is recessive, our results imply that (at least in HeLa cells) wild-type poliovirus not only actively inhibits translation of cellular mRNAs, but also avoids early inhibition of its own protein synthesis. Cleavage of the cap-binding complex protein P220, which has been associated with the selective inhibition of capped mRNA translation, did not occur in mutant-infected cells. This result supports the hypothesis that cleavage of P220 plays an important role in normal poliovirus-mediated translational inhibition.",1985,40,155,6,0,6,13,14,14,10,9,13,13,1

Cholesterol accumulation in ER membranes prevents Scap transport and decreases cholesterol synthesis. Previously, we provided evidence that cholesterol inhibition is initiated when cholesterol binds to loop 1 of Scap, which projects into the ER lumen. Within cells, this binding causes loop 1 to dissociate from loop 7, another luminal Scap loop. However, we have been unable to demonstrate this dissociation when we added cholesterol to isolated complexes of loops 1 and 7. We therefore speculated that the dissociation requires a conformational change in the intervening polytopic sequence separating loops 1 and 7. Here we demonstrate such a change using a protease protection assay in sealed membrane vesicles. In the absence of cholesterol, trypsin or proteinase K cleaved cytosolic loop 4, generating a protected fragment that we visualized with a monoclonal antibody against loop 1. When cholesterol was added to these membranes, cleavage in loop 4 was abolished. Because loop 4 is part of the so-called sterol-sensing domain separating loops 1 and 7, these results support the hypothesis that cholesterol binding to loop 1 alters the conformation of the sterol-sensing domain. They also suggest that this conformational change helps transmit the cholesterol signal from loop 1 to loop 7, thereby allowing separation of the loops and facilitating the feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. These insights suggest a new structural model for cholesterol-mediated regulation of Scap activity.",2017,27,25,3,2,6,6,4,7,0,0,0,0,0

Since a primary susceptibility factor for psoriasis is the Class I HLA‐Cw6 molecule, we set out to learn more about the features of the epidermal CD8+ lymphocytes. The markers tested were GMP‐17, a cytotoxic granule protein found in activated cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), and the alpha chain of the IL‐2 receptor (CD25), a plasma membrane molecule found on activated T cells. Lymphocytes in lesional skin expressed the GMP‐17 protein, whereas lymphocytes in non‐lesional skin, resolving lesional skin and normal skin had little or no GMP‐17. By flow cytometry analysis, lesional epidermal GMP‐17+ cells were CD8+CD3+, with a subpopulation expressing the activation marker CD25+.

59c0015b1d529a1e145da4497a573638baaebed7,Cooperative capture synthesis: yet another playground for copper-free click chemistry.,"Click chemistry describes a family of modular, efficient, versatile and reliable reactions which have acquired a pivotal role as one of the most useful synthetic tools with a potentially broad range of applications. While copper(i)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition is the most widely adopted click reaction in the family, the fact that it is cytotoxic restricts its practice in certain situations, e.g., bioconjugation. Consequently, researchers have been exploring the development of copper-free click reactions, the most popular example so far being strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloadditions. An early example of copper-free click reactions that is rarely mentioned in the literature is the cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CB-AAC). Despite the unique ability of CB-AAC to generate mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) - in particular, rotaxanes - its slow reaction rate and narrow substrate acceptance limit its scope. In this Tutorial Review, we describe our efforts of late in developing the fundamental principles and practical applications of a new copper-free click reaction - namely, cooperative capture synthesis, whereby introducing a cyclodextrin (CD) as an accelerator in CB-AAC, hydrogen bonding networks are formed between the rims of CD and CB6 in a manner that is positively cooperative, giving rise to a high level of pre-organisation during efficient and quick rotaxane formation. For example, [4]rotaxanes can be prepared nearly quantitatively within a minute in water. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that CB-AAC can accommodate a wider substrate tolerance by introducing pillararenes as promoters. To date, we have put cooperative capture synthesis into practice by (i) preparing polyrotaxanes containing up to 200 rings in nearly quantitative yields, (ii) trapping conformational isomers of polymacrocycles as rings in rotaxanes, (iii) demonstrating solid-state fluorescence and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) processes by fixing the fluorophores in a rotaxane and (iv) establishing the principle of supramolecular encryption in the preparation of dynamically and reversibly tunable fluorescent security inks.",2016,52,84,0,10,21,14,19,10,10,0,0,0,0

f99470f8768387f5238a7b0fa75bcf4185bae530,The Conservation of Orbital Symmetry,"Chemistry remains an experimental science. The theory of chemical bonding leaves much to be desired. Yet, the past 20 years have been marked by a fruitful symbiosis of organic chemistry and molecular orbital theory. Of necessity this has been a marriage of poor theory with good experiment. Tentative conclusions have been arrived a t on the basis of theories which were such a patchwork on approximations that they appeared to have no right to work; yet, in the hands of clever experimentalists, these ideas were transformed into novel molecules with unusual properties. In the same way, by utilizing the most simple but fundamental concepts of molecular orbital theory we have in the past 3 years been able to rationalize and predict the stereochemical course of virtually every concerted organic reaction.' In our work we have relied on the most basic ideas of molecular orbital theory-the concepts of symmetry, overlap, interaction, bonding, and the nodal structure of wave functions. The lack of numbers in our discussion is not a weakness-it is its greatest strength. Precise numerical values would have to result from some specific sequence of approximations. But an argument from first principles or symmetry, of necessity qualitative, is in fact much stronger than the deceptively authoritative numerical result. For, if the simple argument is true, then any approximate method, as well as the now inaccessible exact solution, must obey it. The simplest description of the electronic structure of a stable molecule is that i t is characterized by a finite band of doubly occupied electronic levels, called bonding orbitals, separated by a gap from a corresponding band of unoccupied, antiboding levels as well as a continuum of higher levels. The magnitude of the gap may range from 40 kcal/mole for highly delocalized, large aromatic systems to 250 kcal/mole for saturated hydrocarbons. It should be noted in context that socalled nonbonding electrons of heteroatoms are in fact bonding. Consider a simple reaction of two molecules to give a third species, proceeding in a nonconcerted manner through a diradical intermediate I.

By using a biological assay, we found that expression of the 5' gene is suppressed when there was selection for the 3' gene and expression of the 3' gene is suppressed when there is selection for the 5' gene (M. Emerman and H. M. Temin, Cell 39:459-467, 1984). In the present study, we replaced the thymidine kinase promoter with stronger promoters, and we measured expression of the genes in the retrovirus vectors by enzyme activity and RNA analysis. We found that all of the vectors displayed gene suppression when analyzed biochemically, although not when analyzed biologically. The suppressed genes produced about 10 to 50% as much product as when they were selected. The amount of suppression depended on whether the suppressed gene was 5' or 3' to the selected gene and from which promoter the suppressed gene was transcribed. The amount of suppression correlated with a decrease in the amount of steady-state RNA transcribed from the suppressed gene's promoter.",1986,0,141,0,4,8,4,7,5,4,3,8,9,7

In the proposed approach, instead of freely moving individual neutrons/protons, nucleons exist in the form of tightly bound np and npn (and pnp also for proton rich nuclei) quasi-particles, which move in overall Coulomb well due to all other quasi-particles. The proposed approach was found to be very useful in understanding many unexplained phenomena [1]. Now, the existence of np and npn quasi-particles is found to be strongly confirmed by the presence of magic numbers across the periodic table where many stable nuclei with different atomic number are found to be have same number of np and npn. For example, there are 30 different stable (or most stable isotope of nuclei with no stable isotope) nuclei with different Z having the magic number of 38 np, 20 nuclei with the magic number of 32 np and 16 with magic number of 40 np.",2016,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Two isoforms of COX exist: a constitutive (COX-1) and an inducible (COX-2) enzyme. Nitric oxide is derived from L-arginine by isoforms of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39): constitutive (cNOS; calcium-dependent) and inducible (iNOS; calcium-independent). Here we have investigated inducible isoforms of COX and NOS in the acute, chronic, and resolving stages of a murine air pouch model of granulomatous inflammation. COX and NOS activities were measured in skin samples in the acute phase, up to 24 h. Activities in granulomatous tissue were measured at 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 days for the chronic and resolving stages of inflammation. COX-1 and COX-2 proteins were assessed by Western blot. COX activity in the skin increased over the first 24 h and continued to rise up to day 14. COX-2 protein rose progressively, also peaking at day 14. COX-1 protein remained unaltered throughout. The iNOS activity increased over the first 24 h in the skin, with a further major increase in the granulomatous tissue between days 3 and 7, followed by a decrease at day 14 and a further increase at day 21. The rise in COX and NOS activities in the skin during the acute phase reinforces the proinflammatory role for prostanoids and suggests one also for nitric oxide. However, in the chronic and resolving stages, a dissociation of COX and NOS activity occurred. Thus, there may be differential regulation of these enzymes, perhaps due to the changing pattern of cytokines during the inflammatory response.",1994,0,1027,26,7,36,45,46,45,52,54,52,73,50

Although a wide variety of fluorescent probes are currently available, the number of probes that can be applied simultaneously is often limited by the overlaps among their fluorescence spectra. We developed the experimental system to measure and analyze many overlapping fluorescent components in single cells. It is based on the recording of two-dimensional single-cell fluorescence spectra and on the blind spectral decomposition of fluorescence data by method of parallel factor analysis. Because this method does not require any preknowledge about the shapes of individual component spectra, it can be applied to the specimens that contain fluorescent components with unknown spectra. By examining the performance using the mixture solutions of fluorescent indicators, it was confirmed that >10 largely overlapping spectral components could be easily separated. The effectiveness in the physiological experiments was proven in the applications to the temporal analysis of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and pH, as well as the intrinsic fluorescent components, in single mouse oocytes.",2004,32,34,1,1,1,4,2,4,4,1,1,1,3

Previous transplant studies have demonstrated that higher doses of total-body irradiation result in less disease recurrence, but more toxicity. In this study, the possibility of delivering radiotherapy specifically to marrow using a radiolabeled anti-CD33 antibody (p67) was explored. Biodistribution studies were performed in nine patients using .05-.5 mg/kg p67 trace-labeled with 131I. In most patients initial specific uptake of 131I-p67 in the marrow was seen, but the half-life of the radiolabel in the marrow space was relatively brief, ranging from 9–41 hr, presumably due to modulation of the 131I-p67-CD33 complex with subsequent digestion and release of 131I from the marrow space. In four of nine patients these biodistribution studies demonstrated that with 131I-p67 marrow and spleen would receive more radiation than any normal nonhematopoietic organ, and therefore these four patients were treated with 110–330 mCi 131I conjugated to p67 followed by a standard transplant regimen of cyclophosphamide plus 12 Gy TBI. All four patients tolerated the procedure well and three of the four are alive in remission 195–477 days posttransplant. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a radiolabeled antimyeloid antibody as part of a marrow transplant preparative regimen and also highlights a major limitation of using conventionally labeled anti-CD33—namely, the short residence time in marrow. Strategies to overcome this limitation include the use of alternative labeling techniques or the selection of cell surface stable antigens as targets.",1992,0,169,2,3,6,5,5,5,5,2,6,10,13

Currents activated by glutamate receptor (GluR) agonists were recorded from outside‐out patches isolated from the soma of visually identified pyramidal neurones of the CA3 and CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. alpha‐Amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), L‐glutamate (L‐Glu), and kainate (KA) were delivered either by bath application through perfusion of the recording chamber or by rapid application via a piezo‐driven two‐barrelled fast application system. 2. Bath application of each of the three agonists activated inward currents in all patches (n = 134) at holding potentials of ‐50 or ‐60 mV. The current amplitude increased in size between 3 to 30 microM‐AMPA and 100 microM to 1 mM‐KA. With this slow mode of bath application, the responses showed no apparent desensitization even at saturating concentrations of AMPA (30 microM) and KA (1 mM). 3. The ratio of currents activated by 30 microM‐AMPA and 300 microM‐KA showed a characteristic difference between CA3 and CA1 neurones. The ratio was 0.242 +/‐ 0.028 (mean +/‐ S.E.M., n = 16) for CA3 cell patches and 0.097 +/‐ 0.012 (n = 8) for CA1 cell patches indicating that GluRs in the two cell populations are different. 4. The steady‐state current‐voltage relations (I‐Vs) for AMPA‐ and KA‐activated currents showed pronounced outward rectification for both cell types (when the main cations are Na+ in the bath and Cs+ in the pipette solution). The current reversed close to 0 mV and the ratio of chord conductances 80 mV on either side of the reversal potential was 2.66 for KA‐activated currents in CA3 cell patches and 2.60 in CA1 cell patches. AMPA‐activated currents showed a time‐dependent increase after steps to positive membrane potentials and a decrease after steps to negative voltages, indicating that a gating process is responsible for outward rectification of the steady‐state I‐V. 5. The permeability (P) of GluR channels was high for Na+ as compared to Cs+ for both cell types (PNa/PCs = 0.88 and 0.84). The permeability was low for N‐methyl‐D‐glucamine+ (PNMG/PCs < or = 0.03) and Ca2+ (PCa/PCs < or = 0.05). 6. The current noise level increased during application of AMPA or KA. Apparent single‐channel conductances obtained from fluctuation analysis were higher for AMPA than for KA, but similar for both cell types. In CA3 cell patches, AMPA activated channels with an apparent chord conductance of 7.2 pS, KA of 3.0 pS conductance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1992,52,264,12,3,21,18,23,24,23,19,15,9,14

Two groups of recipients were conditioned for marrow grafting by 1,200 R of whole body irradiation followed within 4 hr by infusion of hemopoietic cells from the incompatible littermate. Group 1 consisted of 12 dogs not given a preceding blood transfusion. Group 2 was made up of 9 dogs given 3 transfusions on each of 3 occasions: 24, 17, and 10 days before grafting. All 12 dogs in group 1 showed prompt and sustained marrow engraftment. Six of nine dogs in group 2 showed acute marrow graft rejection and died with marrow hypoplasia. Three showed sustained hemopoietic engraftment. It was concluded that multiple prior transfusions from unrelated dogs in most instances immunized a recipient and prevented subsequent marrow engraftment from a histoincompatible littermate",1972,0,14,0,0,1,2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0

Reduction of the molybdena is significantly facilitated by the incorporation of Ni 2+ ions and the final degree of reduction of Ni 2+ is strongly influenced by the surface Ni/Mo ratio, which can be controlled by the sequence of impregnation during catalyst preparation.",1982,22,68,0,0,4,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2

76a0b94d7a7e7438da44857d895a49aa08699883,Presynaptic inhibition of the spinal monosynaptic reflex pathway,"At present two distinct types of inhibition in the lumbosacral spinal cord of the cat are known. One type is effected by changes in the membrane potential (the inhibitory post-synaptic potential, IPSP) and in the excitability of the post-synaptic cell, and may, therefore, be referred to as postsynaptic inhibition. The characteristics of the IPSP have recently been reviewed (Eccles, 1957, 1961a, b; Kuffler, 1959; Frank & Fuortes, 1961). The second type of inhibition is characterized by a depression in the size of the excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) without any detectable change in the resting membrane potential or in the excitability of the postsynaptic cell (Frank & Fuortes, 1957; Frank, 1959; Eccles, Eccles & Magni, 1960, 1961). Since there is evidence that the EPSP depression is a consequence of a depolarization of primary afferent fibres (Eccles, Eccles & Magni, 1961; Eccles, Magni & Willis, 1962; see also Eccles, 1961 a, b), this type of inhibition may be termed presynaptic inhibition. A convenient method of testing for inhibition in the spinal cord is to study the effect of conditioning volleys in various afferent nerve fibres upon the height of the monosynaptic reflex spike produced by a particular motor nucleus (Renshaw, 1942; Lloyd, 1946a, b; Laporte & Lloyd, 1952). The results of the present study show, by using this technique under conditions suitable for the production of presynaptic inhibition, that there is a powerful and prolonged depression of the monosynaptic reflex discharge; and arguments are presented that the reflex depression observed is due to presynaptic inhibition.",1962,37,266,11,3,4,6,7,4,4,3,7,7,4
d76f879cd975f8e4f27039ceab82faefeeb79247,How we detect microbes and respond to them: the Toll‐like receptors and their transducers,"Macrophages and dendritic cells are in the front line of host defense. When they sense host invasion, they produce cytokines that alert other innate immune cells and also abet the development of an adaptive immune response. Although lipolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan, unmethylated DNA, and other microbial products were long known to be the primary targets of innate immune recognition, there was puzzlement as to how each molecule triggered a response. It is now known that the Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) are the principal signaling molecules through which mammals sense infection. Each TLR recognizes a restricted subset of molecules produced by microbes, and in some circumstances, only a single type of molecule is sensed (e.g., only LPS is sensed by TLR4). TLRs direct the activation of immune cells near to and far from the site of infection, mobilizing the comparatively vast immune resources of the host to confine and defeat an invasive organism before it has become widespread. The biochemical details of TLR signaling have been analyzed through forward and reverse genetic methods, and full elucidation of the molecular interactions that transpire within the first minutes following contact between host and pathogen will soon be at hand.",2003,73,585,28,0,43,59,55,43,46,27,39,31,39

We explore here the recombination of components linked by CC and CN bonds through reversible double-bond formation, and cleavage in CC/CC and CC/CN exchange processes. The reversibility of the Knoevenagel reaction has been explored, and CC/CC C/C exchanges have been achieved among different benzylidenes, under organocatalysis by secondary amines such as L-proline. The substituents of these benzylidenes were shown to play a very important role in the kinetics of the exchange reactions. L-Proline is also used to catalyze the reversible CC/CC exchange between Knoevenagel derivatives of barbituric acid and malononitrile. Finally, the interconversion between Knoevenagel derivatives of dimethylbarbituric acid and imines (CC/CN exchange) has been studied and was found to occur rapidly in the absence of catalyst.

We identified five cDNA clones encoding receptor tyrosine kinases for which the ligand is known (fibroblast growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, epithelial growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, and insulin-like growth factor receptor), two putative receptor tyrosine kinases for which the ligand remains to be identified (the products of ryk and the mouse klg homolog), and a novel tyrosine kinase. We cloned cDNAs encoding both the murine and human homologs of this kinase, the sequences of which were subsequently published under the names sky (Ohashi, K., Mizuno, K., Kuma, K., Miyata, T., and Nakamura, T.(1994) Oncogene 9, 699-705) and rse (Mark, M. R., Scadden, D. T., Wang, Z., Gu, Q., Goddard, A., and Godowski, P. J.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10720-10728). Mouse sky RNA levels are abundant in mammary tumors derived from transgenic mice that express wnt-1, fgf-3, or both oncogenes in their mammary glands. However, little or no expression of sky is detected in mammary glands from virgin animals or in preneoplastic mammary glands from wnt-1 transgenic mice. Moreover, we find that the human homolog of sky is expressed at elevated levels when normal human mammary epithelial cells are rendered tumorigenic by the introduction of two viral oncogenes. Transient transfection of the human SKY cDNA into the quail fibrosarcoma cell line QT6 reveals that SKY is an active tyrosine kinase that augments the level of cellular phosphotyrosine. Introduction of murine Sky into RatB1a fibroblasts by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer results in morphological transformation, growth in soft agar, and the formation of tumors in nude mice. These data raise the possibility that the Sky tyrosine kinase is involved in the development and/or progression of mammary tumors.",1995,34,54,5,1,4,5,4,7,7,5,1,1,1

We report the identification of a new endogenous metabolite, N(4)-(N-acetylaminopropyl)spermidine and the use of a novel proteomics based method for the investigation of its protein interaction using metabolite immobilization on agarose beads. The metabolite was isolated from the organism Pyrococcus furiosus, and structurally characterized through an iterative process of synthesizing candidate molecules and comparative analysis using accurate mass LC-MS/MS. An approach developed for the selective preparation of N(1)-acetylthermospermine, one of the possible structures of the unknown metabolite, provides a convenient route to new polyamine derivatives through methylation on the N(8) and N(4) of the thermospermine scaffold. The biochemical role of the novel metabolite as well as that of two other polyamines: spermidine and agmatine is investigated through metabolite immobilization and incubation with native proteins. The identification of eleven proteins that uniquely bind with N(4)-(N-acetylaminopropyl)spermidine, provides information on the role of this novel metabolite in the native organism. Identified proteins included hypothetical ones such as PF0607 and PF1199, and those involved in translation, DNA synthesis and the urea cycle like translation initiation factor IF-2, 50S ribosomal protein L14e, DNA-directed RNA polymerase, and ornithine carbamoyltransferase. The immobilization approach demonstrated here has the potential for application to other newly discovered endogenous metabolites found through untargeted metabolomics, as a preliminary screen for generating a list of proteins that could be further investigated for specific activity.",2009,39,41,0,2,4,2,8,2,0,5,5,4,5

Although not fully explored, preliminary results also show that circular sampling may have advantages over the conventional rectilinear FSE in signal‐to‐noise ratio and imaging efficiency. A major disadvantage is the increased sensitivity to off‐resonance effects.

APP is closely related to APP-like protein (APLP) 1 and APLP2, but only APP is known to be cleaved by BACE 1 and to be involved in Alzheimer disease. We now demonstrate that similar to APP, APLP1 and APLP2 are also cleaved by BACE 1 but not by ADAM 9, another APP protease, and also transactivate nuclear Tip60 in a complex with Fe65. Paradoxically, although BACE 1 cleavage appears to be specific for APP and APLPs, their cleavage sequences exhibit no homology, and a short sequence (7 amino acids) from APP that when placed close to the membrane converts a membrane protein that is normally not cleaved by BACE 1 into a BACE 1 substrate.

Essentially it depends on the altered expression of competition by a reference antagonist. It incorporates tests for validating its application and it is independent of agonist concentration‐effect curve shape: in these respects the method is analogous to Schild plot‐analysis of simple competition. 3 The methodology for the practical application of the analysis is exemplified by studying the net effect of a combination of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (isobutylmethylxanthine) and histamine H2‐ receptor antagonist (metiamide) on histamine‐stimulated tachycardia in guinea‐pig, isolated, right atrium. Cimetidine was used as the reference antagonist. 4 The equation used in this analysis is similar in form to one recently described by Hughes & Mackay (1985) to elucidate the situation when competitive antagonism occurs in combination with functional interactions. The relation between their method and the present analysis is discussed.",1986,25,38,1,1,1,2,2,3,2,3,2,1,1

Evidence from FTIR difference spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis.,"By specific (13)C labeling of the heme propionates, four bands in the reduced-minus-oxidized FTIR difference spectrum of cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans have been assigned to the heme propionates [Behr, J., Hellwig, P., Mäntele, W., and Michel, H. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 7400-7406]. To attribute these signals to the individual propionates, we have constructed seven cytochrome coxidase variants using site-directed mutagenesis of subunit I. The mutant enzymes W87Y, W87F, W164F, H403A, Y406F, R473K, and R474K were characterized by measurement of enzymatic turnover, proton pumping activity, and Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Whereas the mutant enzymes W164F and Y406F were found to be structurally altered, the other cytochrome c oxidase variants were suitable for band assignment in the infrared. Reduced-minus-oxidized FTIR difference spectra of the mutant enzymes were used to identify the ring D propionate of heme a as a likely proton acceptor upon reduction of cytochromic oxidase. The ring D propionate of heme a(3) might undergo conformational changes or, less likely, act as a proton donor.",2000,0,68,3,1,5,4,6,6,2,4,2,4,3

Its relationship to the structure of cleaved alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor.","The crystal structure of plakalbumin, a proteolytically nicked form of ovalbumin, has been determined to a resolution of 2.8 A by the isomorphous replacement method and preliminary refinement. The structure closely resembles that of the cleaved form of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, with some important exceptions. The disposition of the new carboxyl chain terminus liberated by proteolysis is different with respect to the central beta-sheet A in the structures of these two molecules. In alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, the new chain terminus inserts in beta-sheet A to add a middle strand to the sheet. In plakalbumin, this strand remains free near the site at which the cleavage occurs. A structural basis for this difference in behavior is proposed from the structures and sequences of these two molecules and other members of the serpin family. The structures and positions of the putative signal peptide of ovalbumin, the several post-translational modifications, and the relationship of the intron-exon patterns of plakalbumin and alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor to their protein structures are also described.",1990,46,145,0,3,14,14,12,13,13,17,7,6,2

All four proteins exhibit three different rebinding processes. The data are interpreted by a model in which the carbon monoxide, moving from the solvent to the binding site at the ferrous heme iron, encounters three barriers. The temperature dependences of the three processes yield activation enthalpies and entropies for the three barriers for all four proteins. Binding at temperatures below about 200 K is nonexponential, implying that the innermost barrier has a distribution of activation enthalpies. The distributions for the four proteins have been determined. At temperatures below 30 K, the CO binding rates approach finite low-temperature limits; binding thus proceeds by quantum-mechanical tunneling. Invoking a simple model, the widths of the innermost barriers are extracted from the measured tunneling rates. The experimental parameters are correlated with structural features of the hemoglobin chains and compared with previously published data on myoglobin and protoheme. A correlation is established between the height of the innermost barrier and the equilibrium CO pressure.",1978,29,120,0,6,8,7,7,16,6,4,8,7,4

Dynamic scattering calculations for several model potentials approximating that of the surface are presented. These suggest that the surface is a smoothly corrugated soft wall with a peak-to-trough distance along the [001] direction of \ensuremath{\sim} 1 \AA{} and an attractive well depth of \ensuremath{\sim} 7 meV. Existing methods for generating van der Waals potentials are reviewed and an explanation is suggested for their poor performance in the case of helium. New semiempirical rules fit to the known helium rare-gas potentials and consistent with the recent results of Esjberg and N\o{}rskov are proposed. These are used to construct an approximate potential for GaAs(110), which we show to agree qualitatively with the empirically fit potential. The classical turning-point surface of this potential lies 3.5 \AA{} above the As nucleus. Scattering calculations performed on this potential are shown to agree poorly with experiment. We conclude from this that the scattering is very sensitive to nuances in the potential, and that very accurate surface charge densities will be required before a potential capable of scattering in agreement with experiment can be constructed.",1982,0,44,0,4,5,6,10,3,5,0,0,0,1

We present an appraisal of the ability of the SuperMACHO Project, a next-generation microlensing survey directed toward the LMC, to discriminate between various proposed lensing populations. We consider two scenarios: lensing by a uniform foreground screen of objects and self-lensing by LMC stars. The optical depth for screen lensing is essentially constant across the face of the LMC, whereas the optical depth for self-lensing shows a strong spatial dependence. We have carried out extensive simulations, based on data obtained during the first year of the project, to assess the SuperMACHO survey's ability to discriminate between these two scenarios. In our simulations we predict the expected number of observed microlensing events for various LMC models for each of our fields by adding artificial stars to the images and estimating the spatial and temporal efficiency of detecting microlensing events using Monte Carlo methods. We find that the event rate itself shows significant sensitivity to the choice of the LMC luminosity function, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the absolute rate. If instead we determine the differential event rate across the LMC, we will decrease the impact of these systematic biases and render our conclusions more robust. With this approach the SuperMACHO Project should be able to distinguish between the two categories of lens populations. This will provide important constraints on the nature of the lensing objects and their contributions to the Galactic dark matter halo.",2005,77,129,1,0,3,3,5,4,8,4,12,14,13

Development of high quality AlGaN is the key to obtain high performance AlGaN buffer FETs. An optimized Al0.04Ga0.96N layer on SiC substrate had (002) and (201) X-ray rocking curves with full wide at half maximum (FWHM) of 140 and 450 arc sec, respectively, indicates the comparable crystal quality of AlGaN to that of a typical GaN layer. X-ray reciprocal space mapping and ω –2θ scans showed that the AlGaN barriers grown on GaN and Al0.04Ga0.96N buffers had different Al compositions and thickness, which was attributed to the compositional pulling effect. At room temperature, the AlGaN buffer FET had a sheet carrier concentration and electron mobility of 8.3×1012 cm-2 and 1750 cm2/Vs, respectively. AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN FETs demonstrated a status-of-the-art power added efficiency (PAE) of 53.5%, and a status-of-the-art power gain of 13.4 dB at a drain bias of 20 V at 30 GHz. This device also exhibited lower output conductance and better pinch-off due to the improved electron confinement resulting from the increase in the effective buffer energy height. The device results imply that AlGaN buffer FETs are promising devices for highly scaled transistors in RF applications in the Ka- band and beyond. (© 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Antibodies raised against the synthetic replicate of this peptide have allowed the immunohistochemical identification of GRF-producing neurones within the primate central nervous system4. Such neurones are found mainly in the arcuate nucleus4–6 in human and monkey hypothalamus, suggesting that this nucleus is a primary source of GRF. We have further investigated this hypothesis by studying the anatomical organization of GRF neurones in rat hypothalamus, using an antibody raised against the recently characterized rat hypothalamic GRF7 in normal animals and in animals neonatally treated with monosodium glutamate (MSG), a treatment which results in the selective destruction of arcuate nucleus neurones8–10. We present here the results which show that GRF-producing neurones are located mainly in the arcuate nucleus of rats. MSG treatment results in the complete loss of GRF- immunoreactive cell bodies within this nucleus and provokes a selective disappearance of GRF-immunoreactive fibres in the median eminence. These results show that the arcuate nucleus is the origin of the GRF-containing fibres that project to the median eminence and establish the MSG-treated rat as an in vivo model for studying growth hormone secretion in the absence of neurohumoral GRF.",1984,15,142,5,4,14,17,5,10,5,8,8,3,4

[(14)C]Hymeglusin covalently bound to purified rat liver and to recombinant hamster cytosolic HMG-CoA synthases. The enzyme activity was completely inhibited at a binding ratio of 1.6-2.0 mol [(14)C]hymeglusin/mol HMG-CoA synthase. Incubating the enzyme with 2 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) or 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) but not with 1.0 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP) completely inhibited the binding, suggesting that hymeglusin binds to a Cys residue of HMG-CoA synthase. Recombinant hamster HMG-CoA synthase labeled with [(3)H]hymeglusin was digested with V8 protease, and the [(3)H]peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The sequence of the peptide was Ser-Gly-Asn-Thr-Asp-Ile-Glu-Gly-Ile-Asp-Thr-Thr-Asn-Ala-[(3)H]hymeglusyl Cys-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Thr-Ala-Ala-Val-Phe-Asn-Ala-Val-Asn-, which corresponds to the active site sequence (from Ser 115 to Asn 141) of hamster HMG-CoA synthase.

We examined the effects of CDK1 inhibition in the context of different oncogenic signals. Cells transformed with MYC, but not cells transformed by a panel of other activated oncogenes, rapidly underwent apoptosis when treated with small-molecule CDK1 inhibitors. The inhibitor of apoptosis protein BIRC5 (survivin), a known CDK1 target, is required for the survival of cells overexpressing MYC. Inhibition of CDK1 rapidly downregulates survivin expression and induces MYC-dependent apoptosis. CDK1 inhibitor treatment of MYC-dependent mouse lymphoma and hepatoblastoma tumors decreased tumor growth and prolonged their survival. As there are no effective small-molecule inhibitors that selectively target the MYC pathway, we propose that CDK1 inhibition might therefore be useful in the treatment of human malignancies that overexpress MYC.",2007,46,278,12,1,13,18,17,21,13,22,28,26,20

Whole spleen cells or spleen cell subpopulations were incubated with antigen for 4 d under Mishell- Dutton conditions (education) and the surviving cells tested for regulatory activity in fresh anti-SRBC spleen cell cultures assayed by measuring plaque-forming cells on day 4. The data indicate that (a) whole spleen cells educated with SRBC exert potent antigen-specific suppression in the assay culture, (b) surface Ig- (sIg-) cells (T cells) prepared by either nylon-wool separation or fractionation on rabbit anti-mouse-Ig-coated polystyrene Petri dishes failed to generate suppressive activity when educated alone, in 2-mercaptoethanol, or in the presence of additional macrophages, (c) surface Ig (sIg+) (B) cells educated alone also failed to generate suppressor cells, and (d) mixing sIg- (T) and sIg+, Lyt 123- (B) cells reconstituted the ability to induce suppressor cells under these conditions.

The measured quantum yield for intersystem crossing was found to agree with previous work.

Electronic excitation NO2II(v = 0) + hv → NO2 Ʃ(v = 0, 1, 2) was followed either by fluorescence NO2 Ʃ(v = 0, 1, 2) → NO2 II(v = 0, 1, 2...) + hv, or by quenching NO2 Ʃ(v = 0, 1, 2) + M → NO2 II(v = 0, 1, 2...) + M, causing a non-equilibrium population of the vibrational levels of the ground electronic states. Subsequently, the reactions NO2 II(v = 1) + M → NO2 II(v = 0) + M and NO2 II(v = 1) + NO2 II(v = 0) → 2NO2 II(v = 1) caused a decay of the vibrationally excited molecules with time; this was followed in absorption by kinetic spectroscopy. Because of the rapidity of the last reaction, bands of NO2 II with v >1 were usually observed only in the fluorescence spectrum. In mixtures of 1 to 5 mm of NO with a large excess of nitrogen or krypton, the concentration of NO2 II (v = 1) produced by the flash was of the order of 10-1 mm pressure, i. e. about the same concentration which is present in one atmosphere pressure of NO at room temperature. The absolute concentration of NO2 II (v = 1) was measured accurately by plate photometry, high pressures of NO being used for calibration. The recorded probabilities of vibrational relaxation, P1-0, for NO2 II (v = 1), and radii for electronic quenching, σe, by NO, N2, CO, H2O and CO2, are P1-0 σe(Å) NO 3.55 x 10-4 14 N2 4 x 10-7 ≤ 2x 10-2 CO 2.5 x 10-5 0.6 H2O 7 x 10-3 30 CO2 1.7 x 10-4 5 With the use of an analytic form for the flash duration, the entire rise and fall of the concentration of excited species was quantitatively interpreted.

This metallic orbital permits the unsynchronized resonance of covalent bonds from one interatomic position to another by the jump of an electron from one atom to an adjacent atom without the need for an opposite jump to retain exact electric neutrality. The metal can thus be described as con taining atoms with formal charges + 1 and − 1 as well as zero (larger formal charges are ruled out by the electroneutrality principle3).,1961,3,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The principle of abolition of dangerous physiological functions of the adrenals, of course, is the opposite to stimulation of these glands by a corticotrophic agent, for example, corticotrophin (ACTH). There are several clear indications for the removal of nonneoplastic adrenals at present; no doubt more will be found, and the subject will assume greater importance. Frequently disease conditions caused by adrenal hyperfunction or those mediated through normal activity of these glands can be cured or alleviated by surgical procedures, with impressive results.

In this paper it is pointed out that if a deterministic theory is completely discrete, such as a classical gauge theory on a lattice, with discrete gauge group, then there is an essentially trivial procedure to quantize it. The equations for the evolution of the physical variables are kept unchanged, but are reformulated in terms of the evolution of the transition turns a system into a conventional quantum theory, which may have more symmetries that can be seen in the original classical theory. This is illustrated in a cellular automaton, of which only the quantum version is time-reversal symmetric. Another automation shows self-duality only after Hilbert space extension.

In view of extensive use of Cetrorelix in gynecology and oncology, we investigated its effects on signal transduction pathways of G-protein coupled receptors and adenylate cyclase which are involved in a huge array of cellular events including normal and pathological cell proliferation. Thirty days after a single i.m. injection of 3 mg Cetrorelix pamoate depot to female rats, normal or ovariectomized, we evaluated the effects of this chronic treatment on the expression of alphas and alphai G-protein subunits in the ovary, breast and pituitary, as well as the adenylate cyclase response in vitro to LH-RH, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP). Varied patterns of response to Cetrorelix, depending on the gland and estrogenic status were observed. Western blot analysis showed a modest decrease of alphas and a modest increase of alphai G-protein subunit levels in ovary, a marked increase of alphas and alphai levels in breast, and a lack of effect on alphas/alphai levels in pituitary. In the ovary, adenylate cyclase activity was not changed by in vitro addition of LH-RH, but the responses to VIP and PACAP increased after Cetrorelix treatment. In the breast, chronic administration of the LH-RH antagonist decreased the adenylate cyclase response to PACAP, which returned to normal after ovariectomy. In the pituitary, Cetrorelix abolished the stimulatory effect of VIP upon adenylate cyclase activity. Thus, the LH-RH antagonist Cetrorelix exerted selective modifications at different steps of the G-protein coupled receptors/adenylate cyclase system of signal transduction in the rat ovary, breast and pituitary.",2004,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Several experimental and theoretical studies have provided interesting insights on the functional cycle, but an understanding of the motor's unidirectionality from a non-phenomenological structure based free energy landscape is still missing. Here we use a coarse grained model of myosin V and generate a structure-based free energy surface of the largest conformational change, namely the transition from the post- to pre-power stroke movement. We also couple the observed energetics of ligand binding/hydrolysis and product release to that of the conformational surface to reproduce the energetics of the complete mechano-chemical cycle. It is found that the release in electrostatic free energy upon changing the conformation of the lever arm and the convertor domain from its post- to pre-power stroke states provides the necessary energy to bias the system towards the unidirectional movement of myosin V on actin filament. The free energy change of 11 kcal is also in the range of approximately 2-3 pN, which is consistent with the experimentally observed stalling force required to stop the motor completely on its track. The conformational-chemical coupling generating a successful power stroke cycle is believed to be conserved among most members of the myosin family, thus highlighting the importance of the previously unknown role of electrostatics free energy in guiding the functional cycle in other actin-based myosin motors.",2014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The absorbance spectra of the mutants Arg-82 in equilibrium Ala (Gln), Asp-85 in equilibrium Ala (Asn, Glu), Tyr-185 in equilibrium Phe, and Asp-212 in equilibrium Ala (Asn, Glu) were measured at different pH values during and after illumination. None of these mutants exhibited a normal dark-light adaptation, which in wild-type bR causes a red shift of the visible absorption maximum from 558 nm (dark-adapted bR) to 568 nm (light-adapted bR). Instead a reversible light reaction occurs in the Asp-85 and Asp-212 mutants from a blue form with lambda max near 600 nm to a pink form with lambda max near 480 nm. This light-induced shift explains the appearance of a reversed light adaptation previously observed for the Asp-212 mutants. In the case of the Tyr-185 and Arg-82 mutants, light causes a purple-to-blue transformation similar to the effect of lowering the pH. However, the blue forms observed in these mutants are not identical to those formed by acid titration or deionization of wild-type bR. It is suggested that in all of these mutants, the chromophore has lost the ability to undergo the normal 13-cis, 15-syn to all-trans, 15-anti light-driven isomerization, which occurs in native bR. Instead these mutants may have as stable forms all-trans,syn and 13-cis,anti chromophores, which are not allowed in native bR, except transiently.",1990,0,38,1,0,1,5,5,0,2,0,0,1,2

e4129d4e0bfe8c2155fbd32e5e80a0b4d43fc2ba,GROWTH-PROMOTING FUNCTION OF LEUCOCYTES,"Two main facts were brought to light by the preceding experiments: first, the presence of growth-activating substances in the leucocytes; second, the setting free of these substances in tissues and fluids where leucocytes accumulate. The existence of growth-promoting substances within the body of the leucocytes was to be expected. Leucocytes are embryonic cells and it is well known that embryonic tissues contain substances which stimulate cell proliferation. But the experiments gave a direct experimental proof of this fact. Then, during the whole life and even in extreme old age, there is a supply of growth-promoting substances within the organism which is potentially capable of restoring the activity of the resting cells. Embryonic tissue juice, as is known, can rejuvenate cells which have ceased to multiply in vitro and show evidences of degeneration. If the growth-activating substances of leucocytes can be transferred in vivo to tissue cells, they may play a similar rôle. Therefore, it was important to find out whether the growth-activating substances were set free either by the secretions of the living leucocytes or by diffusion from the body of the cells after they were injured or dead, and whether this phenomenon occurred actually in vivo. Indeed, the idea that leucocytes secrete substances necessary to normal physiological processes is by no means new. Long ago, Ranvier described the lymph cells as mobile unicellular glands, and Renaut thought that their function was to bring to fixed cells the necessary food material. This rôle of the leucocytes was considered by him as absolutely essential. According to his theory, differentiated cells could not live in the absence of the lymph cells, which supply them with the substances required for their activity. The presence of such substances in the leucocytes was shown by our experiments and the growth-activating power acquired by inflamed connective tissue demonstrated that the leucocytes could actually bring these substances to the fixed cells. Under certain conditions, this property of the white cells of the blood may cause the resumption of the activity of tissues which are in a resting state. In the adult organism, the tissues have ceased to grow and the blood plasma has acquired marked inhibiting properties. But growth-promoting substances are still stored in leucocytes, glands, and muscle tissue. The leucocytes could supply fibroblasts or epithelial cells with the necessary food material if they were present where cell proliferation is needed. The existence of mechanisms causing leucocytes to invade tissues in need of repair is certain. The initiation of healing seems to depend on the coming of the leucocytes to the wounded tissue. When they are missing, as happens when the wound is protected from all external irritation, cicatrization is greatly delayed. On the contrary, when staphylococci, turpentine, and other irritants are applied at the surface of the wound, granulations appear after less than 48 hours. These irritants, although different in nature, have the common characteristic of determining an inflammation of the tissues and the migration of leucocytes from the vessels to the surface of the wound. Possibly the white cells bring the substances which adult tissues require in order to cicatrize or regenerate. They would have the function of storing away the growth-promoting substances characteristic of embryonic tissues, and bringing them to the regions of the organism where they are needed.",1922,0,117,1,0,2,2,3,2,0,3,1,0,0

TOP also was purified from dorsal retina by anti-TOP IgG-Affi-Gel 10 affinity column chromatography. In both cases, one major band of protein at Mr approximately 47,000 was obtained. A protein of Mr approximately 47,000 also was purified from chicken embryo brain. Cultured cells dissociated from 8-day chicken embryo retinas accumulated the amount of TOP expected of cells in the intact retina, depending on the position of the cells in the retina. TOP accumulations by cells dissociated from dorsal or ventral retina, mixed in different proportions, and cocultured were additive. These results show that TOP is a protein, that the gradient of TOP is established early in development, and that perpetuation of the gradient does not depend on the continuous presence of an extracellular gradient of diffusable molecules or on maintenance of interactions between cells.",1986,8,16,0,0,0,2,1,1,2,0,1,1,1

The unimolecular reaction NCNO→CN+NO is examined in detail here. Microcanonical state‐to‐state rates are measured in molecular beams at different energies in the reagent NCNO using pump–probe techniques: one picosecond pulse initiates the reaction from an initial (v,J) state and a second pulse, delayed in time, monitors the CN radical product in a specific rovibrational state, or the reagent NCNO (transient absorption). The threshold energy for reaction is determined to be 17 083 cm^(−1) (bond energy=48.8 kcal/mol). Measured rates are found to be sharply dependent on the total energy of the reagent, but independent of the rotational quantum state of product CN. Results of transient absorption measurements are used to argue that the ground statepotential energy surface dominates the reaction in the range of excess energies studied. The energy dependence of the rates, k_(MC)(E), is compared with that predicted by statistical theories. Both standard RRKM (tight transition state) and phase space theory (loose transition state) fail to reproduce the data over the full range of energies studied, even though nascent product state distributions are known to be in accord with PST at these energies. Furthermore, k_(MC)(E) is not a strictly monotonically increasing function of energy but exhibits some structure which cannot be explained by simple statistical theories. We advance some explanations for this structure and deviations from statistical theories.",1987,30,72,0,5,11,5,7,7,5,4,6,4,1

Independently, there is in vitro evidence for correlations between the amino acid sequence in the β2–α2 loop and the propensity for conformational transitions to disease-related forms of PrP. To further contribute to the structural basis for these observations, this paper presents a detailed characterization of RL-PrPC conformations in solution. A dynamic local conformational polymorphism involving the β2–α2 loop was found to be evolutionarily preserved among all mammalian species, including those species for which the WT PrP forms an RL-PrPC. The interconversion between two ensembles of PrPC conformers that contain, respectively, a 310-helix turn or a type I β-turn structure of the β2–α2 loop, exposes two different surface epitopes, which are analyzed for their possible roles in the still evasive function of PrPC in healthy organisms and/or at the onset of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.",2013,72,29,1,2,7,6,2,3,2,2,3,2,0
a3d558c6a49562f2e69314aaac626eb8ffbd2ef2,Proton Spin—Spin Coupling Constants from the NMR Spectra of Paramagnetic Molecules,``Chemical shifts'' for protons in the paramagnetic Ni II aminotroponeimineates are up to 250 times greater than for shifts of analogous protons in the diamagnetic chelates or ligands. These increased shifts are attributed to isotropic hyperfine contact interactions between protons and pπ spin densities transferred from Ni II to aminotroponeimine ligand as the result of pπ—dπ bonding. Widths of the nuclear resonances for these chelates in solution are sufficiently narrow that in many cases spin—spin (I·I) couplings can be resolved. The large separations between the different resonances lead to simple first‐order spectra from which the spin—spin coupling constants can be obtained directly. Proton coupling constants for a number of simple conjugated groups obtained in this way are reported and compared with values for analogous diamagnetic compounds. Close agreement is found.

Profiles for release, over periods of up to 8 h anoxia, were obtained for protein, creatine phosphokinase, myokinase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Two distinct peaks of enzyme release were observed; phase 1 release, which occurred during the first 10 to 60 min of anoxia and phase 2 release which followed phase 1 release and lasted for at least 7 to 8 h. In phase 1, 2 to 5% of the enzyme was released. Reoxygenation of the heart during phase 1 had a marginal effect upon overall enzyme release. Reoxygenation during phase 2 of enzyme release resulted in an immediate and massive increase in the rate of protein and enzyme release from the myocardium.",1973,16,433,4,0,2,7,5,4,13,7,4,6,7
4726092d853390e66b37652b6b768b0222da1a44,"Evolution of Neutron Star, Carbon-Oxygen White Dwarf Binaries","We consider the evolution of neutron-star (ns), carbon-oxygen white-dwarf (co) binaries, using both the Bethe & Brown (1998) schematic analytic evolutions and the Portegies Zwart & Yungelson (1998) numerical population syntheses. The scenario in which the circular neutron-star, carbon-oxygen white-dwarf binaries (ns; co)c have gone through common envelope evolution is considered. In conventional common envelope evolution for the (ns; co)c it is easy to see that the observed ratio a (ns; co)c=(ns; co)e should be 50 because: (i) The formation rate of the two types of binaries is, within a factor 2, the same. (ii) The magnetic elds in the (ns; co)c binaries will be brought down by a factor of > 100 by He accretion in the neutron-star, He-star phase following common envelope evolution just as the inferred pulsar magnetic eld strengths in the (ns; ns) binaries are brought down (Brown 1995). The magnetic elds are not, however, brought down to the 5 10 8 Go f four of theve (ns; co)c binaries. In the earlier literature, the ve observed (ns; co)c binaries were evolved through common envelope, but now a concensus is arising that common envelope evolution is avoided, as we shall discuss. Accepting this, we see that the present discrepancy between observed (ns; co)c binaries (none) and the predicted 50 is great. We show that the introduction of hypercritical accretion, which sends the neutron star into a black hole, is helpful in explaining this discrepancy. One of our main purposes in these evolutions is to compare the schematic, analytic and numerical population syntheses. We show there to be excellent agreement between these two approaches and we outline why this results. a The lower sux e (c) denotes the eccentric (circular) binaries.

ce367b3a973ece8e29aa53f04c9e4416599d0675,On the attachment of ribosomes to microsomal membranes.,"Guinea pig hepatic microsomes were treated with increasing concentrations of EDTA to dissociate into subunits their attached ribosomes. The dissociation process was followed by zone centrifugation and its products characterized by analytical centrifugation. At 20 μ moles EDTA per 0·5 g tissue equivalent of microsomes, only small subunits (∼ 32 s) were released to the sucrose density-gradients in amounts which, according to RNA determinations, accounted for practically all 32 s subunits originally present in the microsomal preparation. At higher EDTA concentrations (20 to 200 μ moles/0·5 g tissue equivalent), the released 32 s subunits were degraded, and increasing amounts of large subunits (∼ 47 s) were detached from the microsomal membranes. After in vivo labeling with [ 3 H]leucine, the detached large subunits contained newly synthesized proteins. Ultracentrifugal analysis confirmed the preferential release of small over large subunits at EDTA concentrations below 40 μ M. A fraction comprising ∼ 30% of the microsomal RNA remained bound to microsomal membranes even after treatment with 500 μ moles EDTA/0·5 g tissue equivalent. Successive treatment with EDTA (500 μ moles) and deoxy-cholate (0·5%) led to the release of this residual RNA which, by analytical centrifugation, was found to be associated with particles, primarily ∼ 50 s particles, presumably large subunits. After labeling in vivo with [ 3 H]leucine, the particles resistant to detachment by EDTA contained ∼ 70% of the newly synthesized protein: presumably the large subunits of active ribosomes are more firmly attached to the microsomal membrane. The initial release of small subunits suggested that ribosomes are attached to the microsomal membrane by their large subunits. This assumption is supported by electron microscopy findings on isolated, negatively stained microsomes. In favorable specimens, the groove that separates the ribosomal subunits could be recognized and was found to be oriented generally parallel to the endoplasmic reticulum or microsomal membrane. The functional implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the processes of synthesis of secretory proteins on attached ribosomes and their subsequent release into the cisternal space.",1966,26,263,1,1,6,15,7,10,11,17,14,12,19

During this mode of DC-to-T cell transmission, uninfected DCs concentrate infectious virions, contact T cells and transmit these virions to target cells. Here, we investigated the efficiency of DC-to-T cell transmission on the number of cells infected and the sensitivity of this type of transmission to the antiretroviral drugs tenofovir (TFV) and raltegravir (RAL). We observed activated monocyte-derived and myeloid DCs amplified T cell infection, which resulted in drug insensitivity. This drug insensitivity was dependent on cell-to-cell contact and ratio of DCs to T cells in coculture. DC-mediated amplification of HIV-1 infection was efficient regardless of virus tropism or origin. The DC-to-T cell transmission of the T/F strain CH077.t/2627 was relatively insensitive to TFV compared to DC-free T cell infection. The input of virus modulated the drug sensitivity of DC-to-T cell infection, but not T cell infection by cell-free virus. At high viral inputs, DC-to-T cell transmission reduced the sensitivity of infection to TFV. Transmission of HIV by DCs in trans may have important implications for viral persistence in vivo in environments, where residual replication may persist in the face of antiretroviral therapy.",2018,55,9,0,3,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The detailed mechanisms for this protection are not understood, but most are thought to be mediated through estrogen receptors (ERs), of which two are known (ERα and ERβ). To investigate the role of ERα in the atheroprotective effect of 17β-estradiol (E2), we ovariectomized female mice that lack apoE (AAee) or lack both apoE and ERα (ααee), and treated half of them with E2 for three months. E2 treatment of ovariectomized AAee females dramatically reduced the size of the lesions as well as their histological complexity. Plasma cholesterol was significantly reduced in this group, although the observed extent of protection by E2 was greater than could be explained solely by the change in lipid levels. In contrast, E2 treatment of ovariectomized ααee females caused minimal reduction in lesion size and no reduction in total plasma cholesterol compared with ααee mice without E2, demonstrating that ERα is a major mediator of the atheroprotective effect of E2. Nevertheless, E2 treatment significantly reduced the complexity of plaques in the ααee females, although not to the same degree as in AAee females, suggesting the existence of ERα-independent atheroprotective effects of E2.",2001,66,185,1,6,15,6,11,6,14,10,8,13,10

Serum LH and testosterone levels and pituitary LHRH-R in male rats are also decreased by high doses of Cetrorelix. This approach can be used for therapy of sex hormone-dependent cancers. However, in conditions where an incomplete hormone deprivation is indicated, lower doses of Cetrorelix may suffice. Thus, we investigated the effect of a 30-day treatment with a low-dose depot formulation of Cetrorelix (20-24 microg per kg per day) on the pituitary-gonadal axis of male and female rats. In both sexes, lower serum LH levels were observed on day 4 after administration. In males, LH returned to control levels by day 10, whereas in females, a rebound LH elevation occurred. Testosterone levels in male rats were decreased up to day 20, but on day 30, the values were similar to controls. In females, serum estradiol was reduced on day 4; however, by day 10 it returned to normal. Progesterone levels were diminished through the entire period. Female rats showed diestrous smears during the first week of treatment and prolonged estrous periods thereafter. The weights of testes and ovaries were significantly lower, but not the weights of prostate, seminal vesicles, and uterus. Pituitary LHRH-R mRNA and LHRH-R protein levels were not significantly different from the controls. Thus, the treatment with low doses of Cetrorelix did not seriously impair gonadal functions. The results suggest that Cetrorelix in low doses induces only a partial pituitary-gonadal inhibition and might be indicated for treatment of endometriosis, leiomyomas, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.",2004,34,29,0,0,4,5,1,3,0,4,3,2,1

Three fourths of the mutations at SUP4 are point alterations; the rest resemble the deletions described by Rothstein (1979). A meiotic genetic fine structure map of the locus was made by crossing 69 of the mutants in all combinations and testing for the frequency of SUP4-o recombinants. The sequences of SUP4 genes cloned from 32 mutant strains were determined by the dideoxynucleotide terminator method, using as primer a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to a sequence adjoining the SUP4 3' terminus. The positions of the DNA sequence alterations showed good colinearity with the positions of the mutations on the genetic map. One of the 26 mutant sites found by DNA sequencing lies within the intervening sequence. At this site three repeat mutations were found, each changing AT leads to TA. Whereas mutations were generally rather uniformly distributed throughout the tRNATyr coding sequence, none occurred in the DNA sequences flanking the mature tRNATyr sequence or in a 12 nucleotide sequence including the 10 bp which constitute the 3' side of the intervening sequence.",1980,34,83,0,1,10,3,3,3,4,4,4,7,6

Here we describe the first three‐dimensional structure and fold of a BRCT domain determined by X‐ray crystallography at 3.2 Å resolution. The structure has been obtained from the C‐terminal region of the human DNA repair protein XRCC1, and comprises a four‐stranded parallel β‐sheet surrounded by three α‐helices, which form an autonomously folded domain. The compact XRCC1 structure explains the observed sequence homology between different BRCT motifs and provides a framework for modelling other BRCT domains. Furthermore, the established structure of an XRCC1 BRCT homodimer suggests potential protein–protein interaction sites for the complementary BRCT domain in DNA ligase III, since these two domains form a stable heterodimeric complex. Based on the XRCC1 BRCT structure, we have constructed a model for the C‐terminal BRCT domain of BRCA1, which frequently is mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancer. The model allows insights into the effects of such mutations on the fold of the BRCT domain.",1998,41,270,9,0,12,30,20,25,24,24,14,15,10

Transgenic mice developed sustained anti-PrP titers, which were not suppressed by introduction ofPrnp + alleles.

Secondary IgE responses in irradiated recipients of syngeneic primed spleen cells.,"The present studies have established conditions for the demonstration of cooperative interactions between specific T and B lymphocyte populations in the development of IgE antibody responses in vivo in mice. This has been accomplished by utilizing a system which permits the successful adoptive transfer to irradiated recipients of DNP-specific secondary IgE responses with spleen cells from suitably primed syngeneic donor mice. Thus, adoptively transferred DNP-KLH or DNP-ASC-primed spleen cells produced high levels of anti-DNP antibodies of both IgE and IgG antibody classes in response to challenge with the appropriate homologous priming conjugate but failed to develop more than meager responses to the reciprocal heterologous conjugate. However, when spleen cells from donors primed to the second carrier were concomitantly transferred with hapten-primed lymphocytes, secondary IgE ant-DNP responses were consistently obtained upon challenge with the heterologous conjugate. Moreover, we have been able to elicit augmented primary IgE anti-DNP antibody responses to either DNP-ASC or DNP-KLH after adoptive transfer of spleen cells from donors primed only to the carrier, ASC or KLH, respectively.

This adoptive transfer system has enabled us to provide direct proof for the participation of θ-bearing T lymphocytes in antibody responses of the IgE class. Thus, the capacity of ASC-primed spleen cells to effectively cooperate with the DNP-KLH-primed lymphocytes in the adoptive secondary response to DNP-ASC could be abolished by in vitro treatment of such cells with anti-θ serum plus complement. This was true not only for the anti-DNP response of the IgG antibody class, but for the IgE antibody class as well.

These studies have, furthermore, demonstrated the capacity to stimulate secondary anti-DNP antibody production in vivo by the concomitant administration of the DNP and relevant carrier determinants on separate molecules. This was more readily seen in the IgE than in the IgG antibody class. Thus, DNP-ASC-primed cells developed significant IgE, but more variable IgG, anti-DNP responses upon challenge with DNP-KLH plus unconjugated ASC. Antibody responses of both classes elicited in this manner were appreciably improved by the transfer of additional carrier (ASC)-primed cells. These and other results presented herein suggest that IgE B lymphocyte precursors may be inherently more sensitive than IgG B cells to at least certain of the functions of T lymphocytes concerned with regulatory mechanisms involved in antibody production.",1973,17,83,0,2,2,3,2,4,4,7,2,6,3

d0434a0db46af38c65de883dca2dba69f3393ca4,"Halogen oxides: Radicals, sources and reservoirs in the laboratory and in the atmosphere","Abstract The central topic of this review concerns the species XO, where X is F, Cl, Br or I. These molecules are thus the radicals FO, ClO, BrO and IO, but attention is also given to some of their precursors in the laboratory and the atmosphere, as well as to their reservoirs, sinks, and other related species of potential atmospheric importance. Laboratory data on the physics and chemistry of the species and atmospheric determinations of their concentrations are both considered. One aim of the review is to highlight the relationship between the laboratory investigations and the atmospheric studies. The emphasis of the review is on gas-phase processes. After a brief introductory section, the review continues with an examination of laboratory techniques for the study of the halogen-oxide species. This section fast looks at the general properties of the oxides and sources of them for laboratory experiments, then discusses the detection and measurement of the monoxide radicals in the laboratory, and ends with a description of the kinetic tools that have been harnessed in the various studies. The spectroscopy, structure, photochemistry and thermochemistry, of the halogen oxides are discussed in Section III. Both experimental and theoretical aspects are presented. The objectives of the work described are on the one hand to establish the basis for the detection of the radical and the measurement of its concentration in the laboratory and in the atmosphere, and on the other to provide the framework for interpreting pathways, mechanisms and efficiencies of photochemical and thermal reactions. Sections IV, V and VI of the review address the main issues of observed chemistry and its kinetics. Section IV gathers together available kinetic and mechanistic information on gas-phase reactions of FO, ClO, BrO and IO radicals, and the available data are summarized in appropriate tables. Section V reports on the corresponding data available for the gas-phase reactions of certain species containing the XO grouping, which include most of the so-called atmospheric reservoirs of XO radicals. There are three sub-sections, which deal in turn with oxide species, HOX, and XONO2. Heterogeneous processes are introduced in Section VI. Heterogeneous chemistry in the atmosphere is that which occurs on or in ambient condensed phases that are in contact with the gas phase, such as aerosols, clouds, surface waters, and so on. It is becoming increasingly clear that such processes are of importance not only in the stratosphere, but also in the troposphere. Section VII of the review is concerned directly with the atmosphere. The sources and sinks of the compounds, the reaction pathways, temporary and permanent reservoirs, observational evidence, the involvement of the species in atmospheric chemistry, and modelling studies are considered for the troposphere and the stratosphere in turn. The section concludes with a more detailed exposition of the role of modelling of the halogen compounds in the stratosphere. The review concludes with an examination of issues in regard to the halogen oxide species that are unresolved, uncertain, or in need of further research. Further data are required, for example, on the spectroscopy and photochemistry of reservoir compounds, on potential organic sources of atmospheric iodine, and even on the channels for photolysis of compounds such as OClO. Within the field of reaction kinetics, there is a need for further study of the kinetics of dimer formation, and of certain other reactions of the radicals themselves (especially of IO) and some of their reservoirs. A substantial number of problems in heterogeneous chemistry of the species remain to be solved. Not only are some key physical measurements missing, but most of what has been achieved in both chemistry and physics is limited to chlorine-containing species, so that the work needs to be extended to the other halogens. There is also a need for a search for novel reactions occurring on conventional surfaces and for all types of reaction occurring on surfaces that exist within the atmosphere but which have not yet been the subject of laboratory study. So far as the atmosphere itself is concerned, there are important issues to be resolved. They include (i) the involvement of halogen species in episodic tropospherec ozone depletion in the Arctic (and a further question about whether or not such depletion is more widespread); (ii) the role of an active halogen chemistry in the oxidation of VOC; (iii) the significance and detail of stratospheric iodine and iodine-catalysed ozone removal; and (iv) the quantitative description of heterogeneous stratospheric chemistry.",1995,968,140,4,0,4,11,10,6,9,7,3,10,8

They are inhibited by ubiquitin protein ligases, such as Nedd4 and Nedd4-2, with loss of this inhibition leading to hypertension. Here, we report that these channels are maintained in the active state by the G protein-coupled receptor kinase, Grk2, which has been previously implicated in the development of essential hypertension. We also show that Grk2 phosphorylates the C terminus of the channel beta subunit and renders the channels insensitive to inhibition by Nedd4-2. This mechanism has not been previously reported to regulate epithelial Na(+) channels and provides a potential explanation for the observed association of Grk2 overactivity with hypertension. Here, we report a G protein-coupled receptor kinase regulating a membrane protein other than a receptor and provide a paradigm for understanding how the interaction between membrane proteins and ubiquitin protein ligases is controlled.",2004,42,84,5,2,5,9,6,13,9,5,8,5,2

b15d21f3762cae56bacee6a47f5f0a1446a7eb8d,Chemical Induction of Colonial Paramorphs in Neurospora and Syncephalastrum.,"G ENETIC ALTERATION in fungi has been found to give rise to two main classes of mutant strains. Most thoroughly investigated have been the ""biochemical"" types of mutants, in which specific defective biosyntheses have been demonstrated (3, 4). The other class includes the ""morphological"" mutant types, which differ from the wild type in growth habit, and which in general cannot be restored to normal by varying the physical or chemical environment of the mutant strain. Distinctive colonial types of morphological mutants have been described as ""button"" (11), ""colonial"" (1), or ""cauliflower"" (8, 13), and several have been shown to differ from the wild type by single genes (1, 11). It has been found that on the addition of certain chemicals to culture media the morphology of wildtype cultures of Neurospora will change so that they closely resemble in growth habit certain genetically determined colonial types. These phenomena are obviously important because of their possible relation to the mechanism of gene-determined morphogenesis in fungi, and also because of their practical utility in handling these microorganisms. The term paramorph is proposed to designate a fungus culture in which morphological changes have been environmentally induced without any corresponding genetic alterations. It is thought that paramorph (paramorphic phenoeopy) or paramorphic culture more exactly expresses the desired meaning than the term phenocopy as used by Goldschmidt (7). Phenocopy has been applied to environmental duplication of specific gene effects on development. Paramorph refers to a class of morphological changes in a less differentiated organism. Since paramorphogenic activity would involve an environmentally induced qualitative change in growth habit, it is to be distinguished from toxicity effects in which a colony may grow to a limited extent before it is killed by a chemical. In the experiments here described, the colonial paramorphic cultures transplanted to inhibitor-free medium have always grown, and have resumed their normal growth habit.

F1-ATPase is the globular domain of F1F0-ATP synthase that catalyses the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate. The crystal structure of bovine F1-ATPase has been determined previously to 2.8 A resolution. The enzyme comprises five different subunits in the stoichiometry alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta epsilon; the three catalytic beta subunits alternate with the three alpha subunits around the centrally located single gamma subunit. To understand more about the catalytic mechanisms, F1-ATPase was inhibited by reaction with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD-Cl) and the structure of the inhibited complex (F1-NBD) determined by X-ray crystallography.


RESULTS
In the structure the three beta subunits adopt a different conformation with different nucleotide occupancy. NBD-Cl reacts with the phenolic oxygen of Tyr311 of the beta E subunit, which contains no bound nucleotide. The two other catalytic subunits beta TP and beta DP contain bound adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) and ADP, respectively. The binding site of the NBD moiety does not overlap with the regions of beta E that form the nucleotide-binding pocket in subunits beta TP and beta DP nor does it occlude the nucleotide-binding site. Catalysis appears to be inhibited because neither beta TP nor beta DP can accommodate a Tyr311 residue bearing an NBD group.


CONCLUSIONS
The results presented here are consistent with a rotary catalytic mechanism of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, which requires the sequential and concerted participation of all three catalytic sites. NBD-Cl inhibits the enzyme by preventing the modified subunit from adopting a conformation that is essential for catalysis to proceed.",1998,34,94,2,1,1,8,4,4,5,4,8,3,7

The enzyme contains two chromophores, 1,5-dihydroflavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate (MTHF). To define the roles of the two chromophores in the photochemical reaction(s) resulting in DNA repair and the effect of DNA structure on the photocatalytic step, we determined the absolute action spectra of the enzyme containing only FADH2 (E-FADH2) or both chromophores (E-FADH2-MTHF), with double- and single-stranded substrates and with substrates of different sequences in the immediate vicinity of the thymine dimer. We found that the shape of the action spectrum of E-FADH2 matches that of the absorption spectrum with a quantum yield phi (FADH2) = 0.69. The action spectrum of E-FADH2-MTHF is also in a fairly good agreement with the absorption spectrum with phi (FADH2-MTHF) = 0.59. From these values and from the previously established properties of the two chromophores, we propose that MTHF transfers energy to FADH2 with a quantum yield of phi epsilon T = 0.8 and that 1FADH2 singlet transfers an electron to or from the dimer with a quantum yield phi ET = 0.69. The chemical nature of the chromophores did not change after several catalytic cycles. The enzyme repaired a thymine dimer in five different sequence contexts with the same efficiency. Similarly, single- and double-stranded DNAs were repaired with the same overall quantum yield.",1990,39,91,2,0,4,4,4,3,3,2,2,0,2

In addition, the accumulation of 3,4‐dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), induced by inhibition of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase by 3‐hydroxybenzylhydrazihe (NSD 1015), was assessed during every 15 min (0‐135 min) after MPTP administration. The alterations induced by MPTP during the first hour after injection were a transient acceleration followed by a marked retardation of dopa synthesis, a decrease in 3,4‐dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; −55%) and an increase in 3‐methoxytyramine (3‐MT; +400%). Between 60 and 75 min after administration, some dramatic changes took place: a 40% reduction of dopamine (DA), a marked additional increase in 3‐MT (to 1300% of control) and an increase in homovanillic acid (HVA; +50%). The period after 75 min was characterized by a further depletion of DA, a decrease in 3‐MT and a transient increase in HVA (max. 240% of control). Six hours after the administration, all concentrations of DA and its metabolites were subnormal, i.e. DA (30% of control), 3‐MT (10%), DOPAC (10%) and HVA (65%). The MPTP‐induced retardation of dopa synthesis was not antagonized by haloperidol or by reserpine pretreatment. MPTP (25 or 50 mg kg−1 s.c.) produced similar acute changes in the levels of DA and its metabolites in rat as in mouse striatum, though much less pronounced.

The Na+ : K+-induced change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and in fluorescence of eosin maleimide bound to the system has been used as a tool. 1 mol of eosin maleimide per mol of enzyme gives no loss in either ATPase or phosphatase activity and the fluorescence in the presence of Na+ is about 30% higher than in the presence of K+. Choline, protonated Tris, protonated histidine and Mg2+ have an 'Na+' effect on the extrinsic fluorescence, while Rb+, Cs+ and NH4+ have a 'K+' effect. Choline and protonated Tris have an Na+ effect on intrinsic fluorescence. A close correlation between the effect of Na+ compared to K+ on the fluorescence change and on Na+ activation of hydrolysis indicates that the observed changes in fluorescence are due to an effect of Na+ and of K+ on the internal sites of the system. The equilibrium between the two conformations, which are reflected by the difference in fluorescence with Na+ and K+, respectively, is highly influenced by the concentration of protons. At a given Na+ : K+ ratio, an increase in the proton concentration shifts the equilibrium towards the 'K+' fluorescence form while a decrease shifts the equilibrium towards the 'Na+' fluorescence form, i.e., protons increase the apparent affinity for K+ and vice versa, K+ increases pK values of importance for the Na+ : K+ selectivity. Conversely, a decrease in protons increases the apparent affinity for Na+ and vice versa, Na+ decreases the pK. ATP decreases the apparent pK for the protonation-deprotonation, i.e., ATP facilitates the deprotonation which accompanies Na+ binding. The results suggest two effects of ATP for the hydrolysis in the presence of Na+ and K+ : (i) at low ATP concentrations (K0.5 < 10 microM) on the K+-Na+ exchange on the internal sites and (ii) at higher, substrate, concentrations on the activation by K+ on the external sites.",1980,26,115,0,1,3,10,12,6,14,9,4,8,4

Detection of stray light was significantly reduced as a result of the confocal technique compared to broad-area measurements. The confocal measurement required no special sample preparation and obtained data was directly interpretable. A polarization ratio of 0.83 was measured on long-wavelength emitting devices and was sustained over two orders of magnitude of low current range. Energy shifts and separation of emission peaks for the two polarization components were evaluated to discuss the valence-band structure. Energy shifts indicated that the topmost band |X 〉 had a heavier effective mass than the lower band |Z 〉. Splitting energy of InGaN was estimated to be 30 meV. Results were consistent with the past reports, thus it was confirmed that the confocal microscope is a valid technique to characterize near-field optical polarization.

The main specificity of the system originates from the stoppering reaction, based on ""click"" chemistry, and thus from the presence of two triazole groups at positions next to the bidentate chelates of the axis central part. The geometry of the coordinating atoms belonging to the axis is such that the triazole groups can either be part of the coordinating fragments when the metal center is 5-coordinate or be not at all involved in coordination to the metal when the latter is 4-coordinate. To be more specific, when the two complexed metal centers are monovalent copper(I) centers, the triazoles are not included in the metal coordination sphere, whereas when the metal centers are Cu(II) or Zn(2+), the triazole groups are bound to the metals. This is easily explained by the fact that Cu(I) is preferably 4-coordinate and Cu(II) and Zn(2+) are 5-coordinate. The interconversion between both situations (4- or 5-coordinate) can be quantitatively induced by metal exchange (Cu(I)/Zn(2+)) or by a redox process (Cu(II)/Cu(I)). It leads to important geometrical changes and in particular to a strong modification of the angle between the two rings. As a consequence, the two threaded rings undergo a motion which is reminiscent of a wing-flapping movement similar to that of birds. This flapping motion is fast and quantitative. It should lead to new functional molecular machines in the future.",2012,55,73,0,9,9,13,10,9,6,5,3,5,3

High‐energy physics is a natural continuation of the traditional efforts by physicists to study the structure of matter. By all standards of comparison, I think we are not exaggerating when we say that achievements in this line of research have been most spectacular in the past sixty years. At the turn of the century, physicists, as we recall, were just looking at the structure of atoms. Thirty years later, the subject of studies progressed to atomic nuclei, and today we are looking at subnuclear constituents.

Naive or immunized female mice were treated by adoptive transfer of spleen cells from mice ubiquitously expressing a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus‐derived cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (gp33 – 41) either alone or in combination with the male H‐Y antigen providing additional antigenic CTL and T helper cell determinants. Low doses of male spleen cells (or sorted B cells) primed CTL, while high doses of the same cells rendered them unresponsive. CTL unresponsiveness induced by high numbers of male spleen cells was dependent upon prolonged persistence of antigen‐expressing donor cells. Unresponsive CTL reverted to a state of activation when the duration of donor cell chimerism was limited. Memory CTL could be rendered unresponsive if antigen‐expressing donor cells were allowed to persist. These results suggest that, irrespective of the type of antigen‐presenting cell and the functional state of the responding T cell, activation and unresponsiveness can represent two different outcomes critically determined by quantitative and kinetic differences of antigen persistence.",2000,46,20,0,1,4,4,1,1,3,2,0,0,0
69a5134c4402782ba56f4ed12d694b33db138081,Dimensions and ion selectivity of recombinant AMPA and kainate receptor channels and their dependence on Q/R site residues.,"1. Recombinant alpha‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionate receptor (AMPAR) subunits (GluR‐A or GluR‐B) and kainate receptor (KAR) subunit (GluR‐6) in their unedited (Q)‐ and edited (R)‐forms were expressed in HEK 293 cells. To estimate the dimensions of the narrow portion of these channels, biionic reversal potentials for organic cations of different mean diameters were determined with Cs+ as the internal reference ion. 2. Homomeric channels assembled from Q‐form subunits were cation selective. The relation between the relative permeability and the mean size of different organic cations suggests that the diameter of the narrow portion of Q‐form channels is approximately 0.78 nm for AMPAR and 0.75 nm for KAR channels. 3. Homomeric channels assembled from R‐form subunits were permeant for anions and cations. When probed with CsC1 gradients the relative chloride permeability (PC1/PCs) was estimated as 0.14 for GluR‐B(R) and 0.74 for GluR‐6(R)‐subunit channels. The permeability versus mean size relation for large cations measured with the weakly permeant F‐ as anion, indicates that for the R‐form KAR channels the apparent pore diameter is close to 0.76 nm. 4. Heteromeric AMPAR and KAR channels co‐assembled from Q‐ and R‐form subunits were cation selective. The diameter of the narrow portion of these channels is estimated to be in the range between 0.70 and 0.74 nm. 5. The results indicated that the diameters of the narrow portion of AMPAR and KAR channels of different subunit composition and of widely different ion selectivity are comparable. Therefore, the differences in the anion versus cation selectivity, in Ca2+ permeability and in channel conductance are likely to be determined by the difference in charge density of the channel.",1996,21,199,23,0,4,20,13,6,13,13,14,3,12

79efb3fc397929f1802a972d51710202dc038ed5,A TDS and HREELS study of CO adsorbed on a potassium promoted Fe(111) surface,"Abstract The adsorption behavior of CO on a potassium promoted Fe(111) surface was investigated in the range from zero to several monolayers of preadsorbed potassium. TD spectra show that the presence of potassium decreases the amount of CO which is desorbed in the α (molecular) desorption state and increases the desorption temperature of this state. In addition, it gives rise to second, β (recombination) desorption state which is correlated to K desorption. The total CO uptake is comparable to that for the clean surface for precoverages of up to one monolayer, beyond this, however, it increases and at three potassium monolayers it is about twice the clean surface value. At K precoverages above 0.5 monolayer the initial sticking coefficient for CO is greatly reduced so that CO exposures of up to several thousand Langmuirs are required in order to saturate the surface. The three stretch frequencies which are observed in HREELS for CO adsorbed on clean Fe(111) are all affected by the presence of potassium. At potassium precoverages between zero and 0.5 monolayers these frequencies shift both in energy and relative intensity; however, between 0.5 and 1 preadsorbed potassium monolayers the spectra are greatly modified and now show only two losses in the CO stretch region. The lower-frequency one of these gives evidence for a close interaction of CO with the coadsorbed potassium.",1985,35,47,0,0,9,5,7,3,0,0,1,2,2

Here we show that a gain-of-function mutation, deg.3(u662), leads to the degeneration of a small set of neurons in the nematode C. elegans. The deg.3 gene encodes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit, which in the region of transmembrane domain II is most similar to the neuronal alpha 7 subunits from rat and chicken. The u662 mutation changes a residue in the second transmembrane domain, the domain thought to form the channel pore. A similar change in the equivalent amino acid in the chick protein produces channels that desensitize slowly. Channel hyperactivity may underlie the degenerations seen in the C. elegans deg.3(u662) mutants, since antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors suppress the deg-3(u662) mutant phenotypes.",1995,58,206,11,2,16,20,19,7,16,12,8,10,4

The Rho GTPase family is essential for neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity by modulating and reorganizing the cytoskeleton. Here, we report that protocadherin (Pcdh) clusters and cell adhesion kinases (CAKs) play important roles in dendritic development and spine elaboration. The knockout of the entire Pcdhα cluster results in the dendritic simplification and spine loss in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo and in cultured primary hippocampal neurons in vitro. The knockdown of the whole Pcdhγ cluster or in combination with the Pcdhα knockout results in similar dendritic and spine defects in vitro. The overexpression of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2, also known as CAKβ, RAFTK, FAK2, and CADTK) recapitulates these defects and its knockdown rescues the phenotype. Moreover, the genetic deletion of the Pcdhα cluster results in phosphorylation and activation of Pyk2 and focal adhesion kinase (Fak) and the inhibition of Rho GTPases in vivo. Finally, the overexpression of Pyk2 leads to inactivation of Rac1 and, conversely, the constitutive active Rac1 rescues the dendritic and spine morphogenesis defects caused by the knockout of the Pcdhα cluster and the knockdown of the Pcdhγ cluster. Thus, the involvement of the Pcdh-CAK-Rho GTPase pathway in the dendritic development and spine morphogenesis has interesting implications for proper assembly of neuronal connections in the brain.",2012,74,98,12,2,9,3,12,11,17,11,12,14,7

It is generally recognized that substrate binding coupled to conformational changes of the substrate–enzyme complex aligns the reactive groups in an optimal environment for efficient chemistry. Although chemical mechanisms have been elucidated for many enzymes, the question of how enzymes achieve the catalytically competent state has only recently become approachable by experiment and computation. Here we show crystallographic evidence for conformational substates along the trajectory towards the catalytically competent ‘closed’ state in the ligand-free form of the enzyme adenylate kinase. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these partially closed conformations are sampled in nanoseconds, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveal rare sampling of a fully closed conformation occurring on the microsecond-to-millisecond timescale. Thus, the larger-scale motions in substrate-free adenylate kinase are not random, but preferentially follow the pathways that create the configuration capable of proficient chemistry. Such preferred directionality, encoded in the fold, may contribute to catalysis in many enzymes.",2007,102,746,16,3,36,63,61,74,58,70,61,59,58

An alternate approach to control the PCE of a BHJ is to tune the miscibility of the fullerene and a semiconducting polymer by varying the structure of the fullerene. The miscibility of a series of 1,4-fullerene adducts in the semiconducting polymer, poly(3-hexylselenophene), P3HS, was measured by dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry using a model bilayer structure. The microstructure of the bilayer was investigated using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission microscopy and linked to the polymer-fullerene miscibility. Finally, P3HS:fullerene BHJ solar cells were fabricated from each fullerene derivative, enabling the correlation of the active layer microstructure to the charge collection efficiency and resulting PCE of each system. The volume fraction of polymer-rich, fullerene-rich, and polymer-fullerene mixed domains can be tuned using the miscibility leading to improvement in the charge collection efficiency and PCE in P3HS:fullerene BHJ solar cells. These results suggest a rational approach to the design of fullerenes for improved BHJ solar cells.",2012,62,178,0,0,22,28,29,15,21,12,20,18,13

In the anemic animal iron is quite promptly assimilated.

In the present work we apply the technique to the cyclo-β-peptide cyclo[(S)-β-homoalanyl-(R)-β-homoalanyl-(S)-β-homoalanyl-(R)-β-homoalanyl] with its amide hydrogens labeled by deuterons. From the 2D spin-diffusion spectrum, it is possible to determine the mutual orientation of the amide deuteron quadrupolar coupling tensors. Assuming that the molecule has four-fold molecular symmetry, the polar angles of the symmetry axis in the principal-axis frames of the deuterium electric-field-gradient tensors are found to be θ=15.7°±1.0° or θ=164.3°±1.0°, and ϕ=±72°±10°. They are used to deduce possible conformations of the peptide based on the result of a previous measurement that correlated the deuterium principal quadrupolar frame with a local molecular frame. We found eight conformations that are all consistent with the NMR measurement. Three of these have acceptably small van der Waals contact energies.

The aim of this study was the prospective evaluation of NTZ given as a single agent in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. Twenty culture-positive patients with dyspepsia who had previously failed at least one course of H. pylori eradication therapy were enrolled. Subjects received 1 g of NTZ twice daily for 10 days. The safety and tolerability of the drug were assessed by physical examination, monitoring of adverse events, and clinical laboratory evaluation. Urea breath tests (UBTs) were performed 6 weeks posttreatment. H. pylori was isolated from UBT-positive patients by the string test or endoscopy with biopsy, and the MICs for these isolates were compared to those for isolates obtained pretherapy. The levels of tizoxanide, the active deacylated derivative of NTZ, were measured in blood, saliva, and tissue from two patients during treatment. The UBT results were positive for all 20 patients after completion of NTZ therapy. The MIC results demonstrated that the NTZ susceptibilities of none of the strains isolated from the patients posttherapy had changed significantly. No major adverse reactions were observed, but frequent minor side effects were observed. In conclusion, NTZ did not eradicate H. pylori when it was given as a single agent.",2003,24,37,0,0,1,1,6,4,0,4,1,0,1

eebaf624fa417dc44ae652a2b9dc961e88653b97,The Hadron to quark-gluon transition in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"In this paper we construct a scenario for the QCD transition from the hadron phase to the quark/gluon phase using physical models for these phases. The hadron phase is modeled by a spectrum of hadrons with masses which drop (with a common scaling factor) towards zero at chiral symmetry restoration. The number of hadronic effective degrees of freedom is limited by the number of microscopic degrees of freedom in the quark/gluon phase. This limitation can be imposed either by fiat or through the introduction of a temperature-dependent excluded volume. Given that the number of degrees of freedom in hadrons and in quarks and gluons are roughly equal, the QCD phase transition is inhibited by the bag constant. The only phase transition seen in lattice-gauge calculations, once low-mass quarks are included, is the restoration of chiral symmetry which occurs at the relatively low temperature of ~ 150 MeV. At present, lattice gauge calculations do not have the resolution to determine the properties of the higher hadronic states accurately. They do, however, demonstrate that chiral restoration takes place in the (ρ. a1), (N(12 +)), (N(12 −)) and (π, σ) systems by yielding “screening masses” for chiral partners which are distinct for T T xSR. Further, within numerical accuracy, these “screening masses” are consistent with pure thermal energies and show no evidence of remaining bare masses once chiral symmetry is restored. These, and other lattice-gauge results, will be discussed in the light of our scenario. We shall also consider the consequences of our picture for relativistic heavy-ion experiments.",1993,40,32,0,2,1,1,4,1,0,0,0,4,3

The average percentages of sugar recovered in the 3 cases are shown in the following summary: The specificity of the insulin action is a very striking phenomenon.

Human globin given to doubly depleted (anemic and hypoproteinemic) dogs by vein contributes to the production of new hemoglobin and plasma protein, but there is some toxicity and weight loss. Dog hemoglobin given intraperitoneally is better tolerated and somewhat more completely utilized with more blood proteins formed and less weight loss. Dog globin (tryptic digest) given by vein in anemic dogs is associated with a moderate production of new hemoglobin. Horse globin by mouth contributes to the formation of new hemoglobin in the standard anemic dog. Dog hemoglobin given intraperitoneally in protein fasting, non-anemic dogs is well utilized to maintain nitrogen and weight balance. A dl-isoleucine supplement fails to improve this utilization of hemoglobin for maintenance in the dog. A small supplement of dl-methionine greatly improves the utilization of dog hemoglobin for maintenance in the dog and further addition of isoleucine is without effect. The intermediary metabolism of dog hemoglobin is not yet worked out.

Vasodilators which inhibit Ca2+-dependent calmodulin interactions with erythrocyte membranes.,"Two new vascular smooth muscle relaxants, bepridil and cetiedil, were found to possess specific CaM-inhibitory properties which resembled those of trifluoperazine. Trifluoperazine, bepridil, and cetiedil inhibited Ca2+-dependent 125I-CaM binding to erythrocyte membranes and CaM activation of membrane Ca2+-ATPase with IC50 values of approximately 12, approximately 17, and approximately 40 microM, respectively. This does not appear to be the result of a nonspecific hydrophobic interaction since inhibition was not observed with micromolar concentrations of many other hydrophobic agents. The predominant inhibition of binding and Ca2+-ATPase activation was competitive with respect to CaM. Bepridil and cetiedil bind directly to CaM since these drugs displaced [3H]trifluoperazine from sites on CaM. Inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase and binding by the drugs was not due to interference with the catalytic activity of this enzyme since: (a) neither inhibition of CaM-independent basal Ca2+-ATPase activity nor inhibition of proteolytically-activated Ca2+-ATPase activities were produced by these agents, and (b) no drug-induced inhibition of CaM binding was detected when membranes were preincubated with these agents but washed prior to addition of 125I-CaM. Thus, bepridil and cetiedil competitively inhibit Ca2+-dependent interactions of CaM with erythrocyte membranes, most likely by a direct interaction between these drugs and CaM. The principal clinical actions of these drugs may be explained by their interactions with CaM or CaM-related proteins leading to reduced activation of Ca2+-regulated enzymes in certain other tissues, such as myosin light chain kinase in vascular smooth muscle.",1984,45,34,0,0,3,8,5,3,8,1,1,2,1

ceac3dd0397d70cf1c0349b0831e41c58a1c6f81,On the Interaction of Mesotrons and Nuclei,"~ 'HE formalism of mesotron field theories was first developed in analogy either with the method of classical electrodynamics that involves the determination of fields produced by pregiven sources, or with the perturbation technique of quantum electrodynamics. This program not only has led to predictions in contradiction with experiment (the singular nature of nuclear forces, and large cross sections for mesotron scattering by nuclei) but is intrinsically inconsistent, for the methods of electrodynamics, involving the neglect of the reaction of field on source, and based on the small magnitude of the coupling between charges and the electromagnetic field, are here quite unjustified. This inconsistency is rendered far sharper by the chargeand spin-dependent couplings of the mesotron theory. These difficulties have led to two apparently unrelated suggestions for modifying the formal treatment of mesotron theory. Thus Heisenberg has attempted a more complete solution of the mesotron equations by including, within the framework of a classical theory, the large reaction of the field on the emitting source. He treated the problem of a neutral vector field interacting with a fixed, spatially extended source to which is attached a classical spin. His calculations showed that the inertia of the spin, arising from the reaction of its proper field, would greatly reduce the spindependent mesotron scat tering. A relativistic variant of this procedure has been elaborated by Bhabha, who based his work on Dirac's classical electron model. Those terms in the field reaction on the source which become singular as a, the spatial extension of the source, vanishes, are discarded and the finite terms are evaluated in the limit of point coupling. However, it is precisely these singular terms that are essential for Heisenberg's explanation of the small mesotron scattering. Furthermore, quite apart from the serious question of whether this method affords a classical description of elementary particles, it is so essentially restricted to the classical domain",1941,0,40,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2

Qualitative perturbation theory and extended Hückel band structure calculations demonstrate that rotation and tilting distortions of the ∞2[Si2O52−] frame have little influence on orbital interactions within the frame. The effects which are observed can be traced to next-nearestneighbor, oxygen-oxygen interactions. Analysis of band widths and crystal-orbital-overlap-populations demonstrate the importance of O(2s) orbitals in the silicate bond. Interactions between Si(3s, 3p) and O(2s) atomic orbitals account for about half of the bonding overlap in the Si-O bond. Crystal orbitals within the ∞2[Si2O52−] frame are perturbed in kaolinite, lizardite, pyrophyllite and talc through interactions of the apical oxygens with octahedrally coordinated Al(III) and Mg(II).

This provides evidence for emission from a normally unoccupied state, located 3.35 ± 0.1 eV above the Fermi level, which is transiently populated in the 2PPE process. Based on the polarization dependence of the adsorbate induced feature this state is identified as being derived from the 2π ∗ affinity level of CO adsorbed on Cu(111).

Indeed, we conjecture that for 2n quasiholes the states realize a spinor representation of an expanded (continuous) non-Abelian statistics group SO(2n). In the four-quasihole case, this is supported by an explicit calculation of the corresponding conformal blocks in the c = 12 + 1 conformal field theory. We present an argument for the universality of this result, which is significant for the foundations of fractional statistics generally. We note, for annular geometry, an amusing analog to black hole entropy. We predict, as a generic consequence, glassy behavior.

It has therefore been proposed that N-myc is itself a protooncogene, and subsequent tests have shown that N-myc and c-myc have similar biological activities in cell culture. We have now detailed the kinship between N-myc and c-myc by determining the nucleotide sequence of human N-myc and deducing the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the gene. The topography of N-myc is strikingly similar to that of c-myc: both genes contain three exons of similar lengths; the coding elements of both genes are located in the second and third exons; and both genes have unusually long 5' untranslated regions in their mRNAs, with features that raise the possibility that expression of the genes may be subject to similar controls of translation.

However, the desired halide substitution event is often defeated by destruction of the sulfur electrophile because the S(VI) Cl bond is exceedingly sensitive to reductive collapse yielding S(IV) species and Cl(-) . Fortunately, the use of sulfur(VI) fluorides (e.g., R-SO2 -F and SO2 F2 ) leaves only the substitution pathway open. As with most of click chemistry, many essential features of sulfur(VI) fluoride reactivity were discovered long ago in Germany.6a Surprisingly, this extraordinary work faded from view rather abruptly in the mid-20th century. Here we seek to revive it, along with John Hyatt's unnoticed 1979 full paper exposition on CH2 CH-SO2 -F, the most perfect Michael acceptor ever found.98 To this history we add several new observations, including that the otherwise very stable gas SO2 F2 has excellent reactivity under the right circumstances. We also show that proton or silicon centers can activate the exchange of SF bonds for SO bonds to make functional products, and that the sulfate connector is surprisingly stable toward hydrolysis.

These structures were solved by the method of molecular replacement and were refined to crystallographic residuals between 0.167 and 0.182. The triphosphate, the ribose, and the purine and pyrimidine moieties of ATP and CTP interact with similar regions of the allosteric domain of the regulatory dimer. ATP and CTP relatively increase and decrease the size of the allosteric site in the vicinity of the base, respectively. For both CTP and ATP at pH 7, the gamma-phosphates are bound to His20 and are also near Lys94, while the alpha-phosphates interact exclusively with Lys94. The 2'-hydroxyls of both CTP and ATP are near the amino group of Lys60. The pyrimidine ring of CTP makes specific hydrogen bonds at the allosteric site: the NH2 group donates hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyls of Ile12 and Tyr89 and the pyrimidine ring carbonyl oxygen accepts a hydrogen bond from the amino group of Lys60; the nitrogen at position 3 in the pyrimidine ring is hydrogen bonded to a main-chain NH group of Ile12. The purine ring of ATP also makes numerous interactions with residues at the allosteric site: the purine NH2 (analogous to the amino group of CTP) donates a hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ile12, the N3 nitrogen interacts with the amino group of Lys60, and the N1 nitrogen hydrogen bonds to the NH group of Ile12. The binding of CTP and ATP to the allosteric site in the presence of phosphonoacetamide and malonate does not dramatically alter the structure of the allosteric binding site or of the allosteric domain. Nonetheless, in the CTP-ligated structure, the average separation between the catalytic trimers decreases by approximately 0.5 A, indicating a small shift of the quaternary structure toward the T state. In the CTP- and ATP-ligated R-state structures, the binding and occupancy of phosphonoacetamide and malonate are similar and the structures of the active sites are similar at the current resolution of 2.8 A.",1990,64,80,2,0,4,5,4,6,2,2,2,8,4

The relationship between rDNA replication and rRNA gene transcription was investigated by the analysis of replication, transcription, and DNA-protein interactions in a mutant rDNA, the rmm3 rDNA. The rmm3 (for rDNA maturation or maintenance mutant 3) rDNA contains a single-base deletion in the rRNA promoter region, in a phylogenetically conserved sequence element that is repeated in the replication origin region of the rDNA minichromosome. The multicopyrmm3 rDNA minichromosome has a maintenance defect in the presence of a competing rDNA allele in heterozygous cells. No difference in the level of rRNA transcription was found between wild-type and rmm3 strains. However, rmm3 rDNA replicating intermediates exhibited an enhanced pause in the region of the replication origin, roughly 750 bp upstream from thermm3 mutation. In footprinting of isolated nuclei, thermm3 rDNA lacked the wild-type dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprint in the promoter region adjacent to the base change. In addition, a DMS footprint in the origin region was lost in thermm3 rDNA minichromosome. This is the first reported correlation in this system between an rDNA minichromosome maintenance defect and an altered footprint in the origin region. Our results suggest that a promoter region mutation can affect replication without detectably affecting transcription. We propose a model in which interactions between promoter and origin region complexes facilitate replication and maintenance of the Tetrahymena rDNA minichromosome.",1998,47,15,1,1,2,2,1,0,2,2,1,1,2

We investigated whether individuals in the Nicoya region of Costa Rica, known for exceptional longevity, had longer telomere length than those in other parts of the country. After controlling for age, age squared, rurality, rainy season and gender, the mean leukocyte telomere length in Nicoya was substantially longer (81 base pairs, p<0.05) than in other areas of Costa Rica, providing evidence of a biological pathway to which this notable longevity may be related. This relationship remains unchanged (79 base pairs, p<0.05) after statistically controlling for nineteen potential biological, dietary and social and demographic mediators. Thus the difference in the mean leukocyte telomere length that characterizes this unique region does not appear to be explainable by traditional behavioral and biological risk factors.

Bronfenbrenner and Hetler, 1 however, did find evidence for the appearance of protein split-products in solution after lysis and hence concluded that lysis was due to hydrolysis of the protein of the bacterial cell. Meyer, Palmer, Thompson, and Khorazo 2 have reported the appearance of non-protein nitrogen during lysis of Sarcina by lysozyme. The detection of minute amounts of protein split-products in culture-media is a difficult matter but the loss of protein may be readily and accurately followed provided the culture-medium itself contains little or no protein. In the present experiments bacteria were grown on the protein-free yeast-extract media previously described. 3 The quantity of cells in suspension was determined by comparing the turbidity of the suspension in water with that of a standard casein-suspension by means of a Klett photoelectric colorimeter. This figure was called “water-insoluble protein” and was found to agree quite closely with the protein-content of growing bacterial suspensions as determined by Kjeldahl determinations of the centrifuged and washed sediment. A second turbidity-measurement was made on a sample of the suspension diluted in 2% trichloracetic acid. This figure is called “total protein.” The relative changes in those 2 quantities is best shown by plotting the water-insoluble protein of each sample against the total protein for the same sample. The changes in water-insoluble protein and total protein during growth and lysis have been determined for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus musca, B. coli, and B. megatherium. The changes in the staphylococcal cultures during autolysis under anaerobic conditions 4 have also been determined.",1938,0,4,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

NO adsorbs with a high sticking probability and may form two ordered structures (c4 × 2 and hexagonal) from (undissociated) NOad. The mean adsorption energy is about 25 kcalmole. Dissociation of adsorbed NO starts already at −120°C, but the activation energy for this process increases with increasing coverage (and even by the presence of preadsorbed oxygen) up to the value for the activation energy of NO desorption. The recombination of adsorbed nitrogen atoms and desorption of N2 occurs around 600 °C with an activation energy of about 52 kcalmole. A chemisorbed oxygen layer converts upon further increase of the oxygen concentration into epitaxial NiO. A mixed layer consisting of Nad + Oad (after thermal decomposition of NO) exhibits a complex LEED pattern and can be stripped of adsorbed oxygen by reduction with H2. This yields an Nad overlayer exhibiting a 6 × 2 LEED pattern. A series of new maxima at ≈ −2, −8.8 and −14.6 eV is observed in the UV photoelectron spectra from adsorbed NO which are identified with surface states derived from molecular orbitals of free NO. Nad as well as Oad causes a peak at −5.6 eV which is derived from the 2p electrons of the adsorbate. The photoelectron spectrum from NiO agrees closely with a recent theoretical evaluation.",1975,15,161,0,0,12,17,7,12,11,11,6,5,14

The increase in BACE1 levels is post-transcriptional and may involve altered translation efficiency. Earlier studies have indicated that translation of BACE1 mRNA is cap-dependent. As ribosomal subunits move from the cap-structure to the initiation codon, they fail to recognize several AUG codons in the 5′ leader. In this study, we looked for physical evidence of the mechanism underlying ribosomal scanning or shunting along the BACE1 5′ leader by investigating structural stability in the 5′ leaders of endogenous mRNAs in vivo. To perform this analysis, we probed RNAs using lead(II) acetate, a cell-permeable chemical that induces cleavage of unpaired nucleotides having conformational flexibility. The data revealed that the ≈440-nt 5′ leader was generally resistant to cleavage except for a region upstream of the initiation codon. Cleavage continued into the coding region, consistent with destabilization of secondary structures by translating ribosomes. Evidence that a large segment of the BACE1 5′ leader was not cleaved indicates that this region is structurally stable and suggests that it is not scanned. The data support a mechanism of translation initiation in which ribosomal subunits bypass (shunt) part of the BACE1 5′ leader to reach the initiation codon. We suggest that a nucleotide bias in the 5′ leader may predispose the initiation codon to be more accessible than other AUG codons in the 5′ leader, leading to an increase in its relative utilization.",2013,39,8,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,2,0

The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is based on clinical, ECG, and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (MBCK) activity. Enzymatic criteria might not be able to confirm the diagnosis of myocardial infarction after recent cardioversion. The routine use of electrophysiologic studies involving the induction and termination of ventricular dysrhythmias provides a setting in which enzyme release as a result of cardioversion alone can be examined. Therefore a systematic investigation of the magnitude and time course of creatine kinase (CK) and MBCK release was performed after termination of ventricular dysrhythmias in 57 patients undergoing electrophysiologic studies. Of patients requiring external cardioversion, only 50% had an elevation in CK and MBCK activity. Elevation when present corrected with the number of shocks and cumulative energy delivered. The magnitude of MBCK release exceeded 10% of the total CK activity in 9% of observations. Pace-termination of ventricular tachycardia did not result in enzyme release. Arrhythmia characteristics, coronary artery disease, and left ventricular function did not affect the magnitude of the time course of enzyme release. These data suggest that cardioversion with multiple shocks may result in a component of MBCK release, and thus a false positive diagnosis of primary acute myocardial infarction may be made by relying exclusively on the enzyme release pattern.",1991,24,20,0,0,1,0,2,0,6,1,2,0,2

In spring 2002, maximum mixing ratios of ethane [34 parts per 109 by volume (ppbv)], propane (20 ppbv), and n-butane (13 ppbv) were observed in north-central Texas. The elevated alkane mixing ratios are attributed to emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. Measured alkyl nitrate mixing ratios were comparable to urban smog values, indicating active photochemistry in the presence of nitrogen oxides, and therefore with abundant formation of tropospheric ozone. We estimate that 4–6 teragrams of methane are released annually within the region and represents a significant fraction of the estimated total U.S. emissions. This result suggests that total U.S. natural gas emissions may have been underestimated.

Knockout mice can be used to study the roles of molecules like BDNF in synaptic plasticity with more molecular specificity than is possible using pharmacological approaches. Because in conventional knockouts the disrupted gene product is absent in all tissues throughout the life of the animal, developmental effects may complicate the interpretation of deficits in the adult. Rescue experiments can help to distinguish between developmental and acute requirements for the missing gene product. We here demonstrate that treatment of hippocampal slices from BDNF knockout mice with recombinant BDNF completely reverses deficits in long-term potentiation and significantly improves deficits in basal synaptic transmission at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse. Thus, BDNF has an acute role in hippocampal synaptic function.",1996,101,1239,80,4,38,59,84,50,38,50,52,43,40

The role of lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) and CD4 in the formation and function of these clusters has been evaluated in the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). By day 1 of the control MLR, most of the DC and responsive T cells are associated in discrete aggregates. Addition of anti-LFA-1 and CD4 reagents does not block DC-T aggregation but reduces the subsequent proliferative response by 80-90%. Anti-LFA-1 disassembles newly formed DC-T cell aggregates, whereas anti-CD4 inhibits blastogenesis without disrupting the cluster. Binding of DC to sensitized, antigen-specific CD4+ cells has been studied using lymphoblasts isolated at day 4 of the MLR. It has been shown previously that greater than 80% blasts rebind to DC in an antigen-specific fashion in rapid (10 min) binding assays. Antigen-dependent DC-T binding is blocked by anti-Ia but not by mAb to LFA-1 or CD4. However, the bound anti-CD4-coated lymphocytes are unable to release IL-2. Anti- LFA-1-coated T cells release IL-2 but are easily disaggregated after binding to DC. These findings lead to two conclusions. LFA-1 and CD4 are not involved in the initial steps whereby DC bind to T cells but exert an independent and subsequent role. LFA-1 acts to stabilize the DC-T cluster, while CD4 contributes to lymphocyte blastogenesis and IL- 2 release. Because DC but not other presenting cells cluster unprimed lymphocytes, it seems likely that an antigen-independent mechanism distinct from LFA-1 and CD4 mediates aggregate formation at the onset of cell-mediated immunity.",1987,40,121,2,1,16,18,6,9,9,10,1,7,3

Here, we show that olfactory bulb neurons secrete IGF-1 by an activity-dependent pathway of exocytosis, and that Syt10 functions as the Ca(2+)-sensor that triggers IGF-1 exocytosis in these neurons. Deletion of Syt10 impaired activity-dependent IGF-1 secretion in olfactory bulb neurons, resulting in smaller neurons and an overall decrease in synapse numbers. Exogenous IGF-1 completely reversed the Syt10 knockout phenotype. Syt10 colocalized with IGF-1 in somatodendritic vesicles of olfactory bulb neurons, and Ca(2+)-binding to Syt10 caused these vesicles to undergo exocytosis, thereby secreting IGF-1. Thus, Syt10 controls a previously unrecognized pathway of Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis that is spatially and temporally distinct from Ca(2+)-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis controlled by Syt1. Our findings thereby reveal that two different synaptotagmins can regulate functionally distinct Ca(2+)-dependent membrane fusion reactions in the same neuron.",2011,67,99,4,3,6,10,9,13,14,8,7,12,11

16f016cc0f993511f680604aee1fdbabcda0403f,"Stability, folding dynamics, and long-range conformational transition of the synaptic t-SNARE complex","Significance Intracellular membrane fusion is mediated by coupled folding and assembly of three or four soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins into a four-helix bundle. A rate-limiting step is the formation of a partial complex containing three helixes called the target (t)-SNARE complex on the target plasma membrane. The t-SNARE complex then serves as a template to guide stepwise zippering of the fourth helix, a process that is further regulated by other proteins. The synaptic t-SNARE complex readily misfolds. Consequently, its conformation, stability, and dynamics have not been well understood. Using optical tweezers and theoretical modeling, we elucidated the folding intermediates and kinetics of the t-SNARE complex and discovered a long-range conformational switch of t-SNAREs during SNARE zippering, which is essential for regulated SNARE assembly during synaptic vesicle fusion. Synaptic soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) couple their stepwise folding to fusion of synaptic vesicles with plasma membranes. In this process, three SNAREs assemble into a stable four-helix bundle. Arguably, the first and rate-limiting step of SNARE assembly is the formation of an activated binary target (t)-SNARE complex on the target plasma membrane, which then zippers with the vesicle (v)-SNARE on the vesicle to drive membrane fusion. However, the t-SNARE complex readily misfolds, and its structure, stability, and dynamics are elusive. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we modeled the synaptic t-SNARE complex as a parallel three-helix bundle with a small frayed C terminus. The helical bundle sequentially folded in an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) separated by a central ionic layer, with total unfolding energy of ∼17 kBT, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is 300 K. Peptide binding to the CTD activated the t-SNARE complex to initiate NTD zippering with the v-SNARE, a mechanism likely shared by the mammalian uncoordinated-18-1 protein (Munc18-1). The NTD zippering then dramatically stabilized the CTD, facilitating further SNARE zippering. The subtle bidirectional t-SNARE conformational switch was mediated by the ionic layer. Thus, the t-SNARE complex acted as a switch to enable fast and controlled SNARE zippering required for synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmission.",2016,45,24,1,0,8,6,2,3,4,0,0,0,0

Annealing the Na-covered sample to 300 K results in irreversible changes of the surface structures: Intermixed NaAu surface layers are formed for θNa > 0.25 ML. A well-ordered c(4 × 2) substitutional structure develops at θNa ≈ 0.50 ML, where every fourth Au surface atom is replaced a Na atom. The structures formed at 300 K are metastable, and upon annealing to 600 K the equilibrium surface configurations evolve: For small Na coverages the periodicity of the Au(111) Chevron phase is reduced. At θNa ≈ 0.23 ML the Na atoms induce a surface phase transformation of the Au(111) Chevron phase into a poorly ordered domain structure with an isotropically contracted surface layer and hexagonal symmetry. At even higher coverages a mixed NaAu2 structure is formed in the topmost layer which covers the entire surface at θNa ≈ 0.50 ML. The NaAu2 structure is arranged in a hexagonal lattice with a (1.08√3 × 1.08√3)R30° geometry where the Au atoms form a honeycomb structure whose central sites are occupied by Na atoms. The lattice misfit between the surface and the second layer leads to a regular hexagonal Moire pattern of ≈ 38 A periodicity and ≈ 0.5 A corrugation. This phase is regarded as a two-dimensional alloy. With adsorbed Na multilayers, Na atoms penetrate into deeper substrate layers and a thin NaAu2 alloy film is formed.",1995,40,40,0,0,3,3,3,0,1,1,0,1,1

Nuclear spin coupling constants,"The molecular orbital theory of hydrocarbons developed in the previous two papers [1, 2] has been adapted to the calculation of nuclear spin coupling constants. Using perturbation theory, long range coupling constants are related to those interactions within the molecule which are responsible for electron delocalization between bonds. The theory is applied to the calculation of all nuclear spin coupling constants in ethane, ethylene and acetylene. For nuclei separated by two bonds, the calculations lead to positive constants in all cases, whereas some negative values are found experimentally. However, the observed trend of increasingly positive values with increasing bond angle is well reproduced. For protons separated by three bonds, the theory gives results comparable with those already achieved by valence bond calculations.",1965,14,71,0,0,4,6,10,6,3,7,3,3,2

To study their relative contributions as a function of the previous history of the neuron's activity, we have examined the effects of inhibiting PKA (using Rp-cAMPS) and PKC (using H7) on the short-term facilitation of spontaneous release as well as of the evoked release induced by serotonin at nondepressed, partially depressed, and highly depressed synapses. Our results suggest that whereas activation of PKA is sufficient to trigger the facilitation of nondepressed synapses, activation of both PKA and PKC is required to facilitate depressed synapses, with the contribution of PKC becoming progressively more important as synaptic transmission becomes more depressed.",1992,29,251,20,0,6,20,55,9,11,17,11,14,8

These animals provide a unique model system for directly assessing the role of CD8+ lymphocytes in the modulation of viral infection in vivo. beta 2m- CD8- mice and their normal littermates were inoculated at the base of the tail with the WR strain of vaccinia virus and monitored for serum antibody and lesion formation. Both groups developed similar lesions in response to a broad virus dose range, and all animals had completely recovered by day 28 after inoculation. Isotype-specific immunoglobulin levels were determined for each animal on day 7 and day 14 after primary inoculation, and again 7 days after a virus challenge. The virus-specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b levels were significantly different in the beta 2m-/- group (20-, 9-, and 30-fold lower, respectively, on day 7 after challenge) compared with the beta 2m+/- group. Virus-specific serum IgM levels for both groups remained similar throughout the experiment. In a separate experiment, beta 2m-/- mice were immunized with a nonviral antigen, 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and both total and antigen-specific isotype-specific immunoglobulin titers were determined. Total IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 tended to be lower overall in the beta 2m-/- mice compared with beta 2m+/- littermates. In contrast, total and antigen-specific IgE titers were similar in the two groups. These data indicate that CD8+ lymphocytes are not required to clear high doses of vaccinia virus, and they suggest that beta 2m-/- mice are less efficient at antigen-specific IgG production than their beta 2m+/- littermates.",1992,1,173,3,1,11,12,9,17,10,10,12,6,9
b21ce4a8bf02221dfe12ea0dcf1e2bff2f8f9a44,The impact of cloud particle gravitational settling on soluble trace gas distributions,"The effect of gravitational settling of cloud droplets and ice particles on the tropospheric distributions of soluble trace gases is examined, focusing in particular on nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. For this study, we separate cloud condensate into two classes: large (rain, snow and graupel) and small (cloud water and cloud ice). The first class has typical fall speeds of several m/s and frequently reaches the ground. The redistribution and loss of soluble trace gases due to this type of precipitation is generally already included in global photochemical models (although the manner in which this is done varies widely between models). However, an additional redistribution can result from the gravitational settling of the second class, small cloud droplets or ice particles, whose mean fall speeds can reach 1 m/s. When we include this additional downward flux term in our model simulations, we find a significant impact on the distributions of the soluble trace gases HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 . In the upper troposphere, the settling of ice particles leads to a strong reduction in the mixing ratios of these gases, due to the relatively high terminal velocities of ice crystals (generally > 10 cm/s). The impact of cloud droplet settling in the lower troposphere is also found to be significant in some regions, though it is generally smaller due to the slower settling velocities of liquid droplets; in addition, the settling loss in the lower troposphere is computed to be frequently overwhelmed by the supply of HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 via sublimating hydrometeors settling in from above. Our findings may help explain the overestimate of free tropospheric HNO 3 found in several global photochemical modeling studies. The reductions computed for HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 also have an effect on the distributions of related trace gases, such as NO x and OH. Gravitational settling might also directly affect other soluble trace gases and aerosols. There are substantial uncertainties involved in computing the global impact of gravitational settling, such as the uptake of gases and aerosols onto and into ice particles and the high degree of variability and complexity of clouds. Results of sensitivity studies examining some of these uncertainties are presented. Even employing a low-end settling velocity for ice particles (5 cm/s) and a minimum ice uptake efficiency for HNO 3 based on laboratory data, we still compute a notable impact on the upper tropospheric HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 distributions.

Propargyl and 1-pentenyl groups have been grafted onto the stoppers of [c2]daisy chain molecules obtained using a template-directed synthetic protocol. Such [c2]daisy chain molecules undergo reversible extension and contraction upon treatment with acid and base, respectively. The dialkyne-functionalized [c2]daisy chain (AA) was subjected to an [AA+BB] type polymerization with an appropriate diazide (BB) to afford a linear, mechanically interlocked, main-chain polymer. The macromolecular properties of this polymer were characterized by chronocoulometry, size exclusion chromatography, and static light-scattering analysis. The acid-base switching properties of both the monomers and the polymer have been studied in solution, using (1)H NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis absorption spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The experimental results demonstrate that the functionalized [c2]daisy chains, along with their polymeric derivatives, undergo quantitative, efficient, and fully reversible switching processes in solution. Kinetics measurements demonstrate that the acid/base-promoted extension/contraction movements of the polymeric [c2]daisy chain are actually faster than those of its monomeric counterpart. These observations open the door to correlated molecular motions and to changes in material properties.",2009,94,152,0,1,18,12,23,14,17,12,10,10,8

An in-frame fusion of the structural genes for these two proteins was constructed by connecting the 5'-flanking region and prepro-leader portion of the coding sequence of the alpha-factor gene (MF alpha 1) to a large fragment of the invertase gene (SUC2) lacking its 5'-flanking region and the coding information for the first four amino acids of its signal sequence. Sites that have been implicated in normal proteolytic processing of the alpha-factor precursor have been retained in this construction. The chimeric gene directs synthesis of a high level of active invertase that is secreted efficiently into the periplasmic space, permitting cell growth on sucrose-containing media. This extracellular invertase appears to contain no prepro-alpha-factor sequences. The initial intracellular product is, however, a hybrid protein that can be detected either by treatment of the cells with the drug tunicamycin or by blockage of secretion in a temperature-conditional secretion-defective mutant (sec18). Therefore, prior to its efficient proteolytic removal, the alpha-factor portion of the hybrid protein apparently provides the necessary information for efficient export of the substantially larger protein invertase. Similar to MF alpha 1, the MF alpha 1-SUC2 fusion is expressed in alpha haploids at levels 65-75 times higher than in a haploids or in a/alpha diploids; also, high-level expression is eliminated in mat alpha 1 mutants but not in mat alpha 2 mutants. Unlike expression of SUC2, expression of the fusion is not affected by glucose concentration. Hence, the 5'-flanking region present in the fusion (about 950 base pairs) is sufficient to confer alpha cell-specific expression to the hybrid gene.",1983,0,129,9,1,4,7,7,16,6,10,4,2,5
b866bb5c2b48e488313d67fa181c2d546de8978b,Helicobacter pylori gene silencing in vivo demonstrates urease is essential for chronic infection,"Helicobacter pylori infection causes chronic active gastritis that after many years of infection can develop into peptic ulceration or gastric adenocarcinoma. The bacterium is highly adapted to surviving in the gastric environment and a key adaptation is the virulence factor urease. Although widely postulated, the requirement of urease expression for persistent infection has not been elucidated experimentally as conventional urease knockout mutants are incapable of colonization. To overcome this constraint, conditional H. pylori urease mutants were constructed by adapting the tetracycline inducible expression system that enabled changing the urease phenotype of the bacteria during established infection. Through tight regulation we demonstrate that urease expression is not only required for establishing initial colonization but also for maintaining chronic infection. Furthermore, successful isolation of tet-escape mutants from a late infection time point revealed the strong selective pressure on this gastric pathogen to continuously express urease in order to maintain chronic infection. In addition to mutations in the conditional gene expression system, escape mutants were found to harbor changes in other genes including the alternative RNA polymerase sigma factor, fliA, highlighting the genetic plasticity of H. pylori to adapt to a changing niche. The tet-system described here opens up opportunities to studying genes involved in the chronic stage of H. pylori infection to gain insight into bacterial mechanisms promoting immune escape and life-long infection. Furthermore, this genetic tool also allows for a new avenue of inquiry into understanding the importance of various virulence determinants in a changing biological environment when the bacterium is put under duress.",2017,73,32,1,1,6,7,7,11,0,0,0,0,0

958fa83de4ba54f0430ac51cd21ca25ae5614adb,Quantum transitions in interacting fields,"In recent papers we have discussed the meaning of dressed excited quantum states. We have shown that these states can be formulated in terms of distribution functions outside the Hilbert space. Our approach applies to ""nonintegrable"" systems in the sense of Poincare. It involves the analytic continuation of the unitary operator U describing the transformation from bare to dressed stable states. This leads to a ""star-unitary"" operator A. Interacting fields are nonintegrable systems obtained as a result of resonances. It is therefore natural to expect that our previous results remain valid for interacting fields. We consider a simple example, which corresponds to an extension of the usual Friedrichs model. This involves a local field in interaction with a bilocal scalar field. This model has been previously studied by one of the co-authors (I.P.). It is a simplified version of the model describing A→B+C transition with quadratic interaction. The usual Bogoliubov transformation eliminates the field corresponding to A, while our method leads to strictly exponential decay of unstable field. The dressed field A corresponds to a singular distribution function outside the Liouville-Hilbert space. As in the Friedrichs model there exists two time scales-one for the preparation of a dressed state and depending on initial conditions called ""Zeno period"" and the other universal for the decay.",2002,0,10,0,0,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

In theory single-isomer drugs may be superior but few have been found to have clinically significant advantages. The manufacturer claims that escitalopram has more efficacy and a faster onset of effect than citalopram. The purpose of this study was to assess how far these claims are justified. Methods: Relevant trial reports were requested from H. Lundbeck A/S and the Swedish drug regulatory authority. The trials consisted of a pooled analysis of 1,321 patients from one unpublished, one partly published and one published eight-week trial, as well as a 24-week trial with 357 patients published as a poster. The studies compared escitalopram with placebo and/or citalopram in outpatients aged ≧18 years who met specified criteria for depression. The trials’ quality was assessed with Moncrieff et al.’s quality assessment instrument and the results compared with the claims from the advertisements. Results: The advertising claims are not justified because they are based on secondary outcomes, non-intention-to-treat analyses and arbitrarily defined subgroups. The subgroup results are inconsistent. Methodological flaws in the trials could account for the differences found. Even if the differences claimed were real they appear too small to justify higher prices. Conclusions: On the evidence available to us the manufacturer’s claims of superiority for escitalopram over citalopram are unwarranted. The Swedish and Danish drug regulatory authorities reached similar conclusions.

This is also a frequent DNA lesion induced by oxidative damage, through exposure to agents such as ionizing radiation, or from endogenous sources that are implicated in the aetiology of degenerative diseases, ageing and cancer. The Ung and Smug1 enzymes excise uracil from DNA to effect repair in mammalian cells, and gene‐targeted Ung−/− mice exhibit a moderate increase in genome‐wide spontaneous mutagenesis. Here, we report that stable siRNA‐mediated silencing of Smug1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts also generates a mutator phenotype. However, an additive 10‐fold increase in spontaneous C:G to T:A transitions in cells deficient in both Smug1 and Ung demonstrates that these enzymes have distinct and nonredundant roles in suppressing C → T mutability at non‐CpG sites.

There appears to have been some uncertainty as to whether the term "" humoral "" referred to the experimental transfer on which that demonstration was based, or to the natural process of release of a specific stimulant into the tissue fluids. In any case I shall have to consider some instances in which the chemical transmitter of nervous effects appears to be released in such immediate proximity to the receptive cells that the use of the term "" humoral "" would risk a misleading implication. For this reason I have chosen to employ the more general term "" chemical transmission "" for the process, and shall refer to the agents concerned as "" chemical transmitters.""",1934,9,114,0,0,6,5,2,2,0,5,0,3,0

Lp(a) also competed with 125I-LDL for binding to human LDL receptors in intact fibroblasts. Binding led to cellular uptake of Lp(a) with subsequent stimulation of cholesterol esterification. After intravenous injection, human Lp(a) was cleared slowly from the plasma of normal mice. The clearance was markedly accelerated in transgenic mice that expressed large amounts of LDL receptors. We conclude that the covalent attachment of apo(a) to apo B-100 in Lp(a) does not interfere markedly with the ability of apo B-100 to bind to the LDL receptor and that this receptor has the potential to play a major role in clearance of Lp(a) from the circulation of intact humans.",1990,26,172,3,2,12,9,24,17,10,12,14,5,12

The Gi-coupled serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) 5-HT1A receptor, heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary or human embryonic kidney 293 cells, mediated rapid activation of Erk1/2 via a mechanism dependent upon both Ras activation and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This activation was attenuated by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ and Ca2+/calmodulin (CAM) inhibitors or the CAM sequestrant protein calspermin. The CAM-dependent step in the Erk1/2 activation cascade is downstream of Ras activation, because inhibitors of CAM antagonize Erk1/2 activation induced by constitutively activated mutants of Ras and c-Src but not by constitutively activated mutants of Raf and MEK (mitogen and extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Inhibitors of the classical CAM effectors myosin light chain kinase, CAM-dependent protein kinases II and IV, PP2B, and CAM-sensitive phosphodiesterase had no effect upon 5-HT1A receptor-mediated Erk1/2 activation. Because clathrin-mediated endocytosis was required for 5-HT1A receptor-mediated Erk1/2 activation, we postulated a role for CAM in receptor endocytosis. Inhibition of receptor endocytosis by use of sequestration-defective mutants of β-arrestin1 and dynamin attenuated 5-HT1Areceptor-stimulated Erk1/2 activation. Inhibition of CAM prevented agonist-dependent endocytosis of epitope-tagged 5-HT1A receptors. We conclude that CAM-dependent activation of Erk1/2 through the 5-HT1A receptor reflects its role in endocytosis of the receptor, which is a required step in the activation of MEK and subsequently Erk1/2.",1999,44,145,5,6,12,18,10,11,8,9,11,8,12

The dust for the inner echo is 0.45 pc < d < 90 pc away from the SN. The inner echo color is consistent with typical interstellar dust wavelength-dependent scattering cross-sections, while the outer echo color does not match the predictions.

The ABEL trap operates by tracking the Brownian motion of a single fluorescent particle in solution, and applying a time-dependent electric field designed to induce an electrokinetic drift that cancels the Brownian motion. The trapping strength of the ABEL trap is limited by the latency of the feedback loop. In previous versions of the trap, this latency was set by the finite frame rate of the camera used for video-tracking. In the present system, the motion of the particle is tracked entirely in hardware (without a camera or image-processing software) using a rapidly rotating laser focus and lock-in detection.

0bf4c7273df24507a8d2b54821a9b4dd794e2014,Biochemistry and the Sciences of Recognition,"An account of the slow emergence of scientific insight is not in any straightforward way a reliable reflection of a life course. I do not intend here to be explicitly autobiographical but want nevertheless to reflect on whether there is a pattern that has unconsciously guided my scientific work. I believe there is one, if I neglect some noisy interludes. Like Moliere’s Monsieur Jourdain, who was astonished to realize that he had been speaking prose all his life, I have come to realize that even when my scientific interests turned to very high levels of organization (organismal, even mental) I had been following the rules of biochemistry. These rules are not just those of organic chemistry itself but also of that chemistry as it emerged under the constraints of genetics and evolution. So although the precision is lent by the syntax of organic chemistry, the semantics or significance of biochemical processes is embedded within the astonishingly rich complexity of cells, organs, and organisms interacting across many layers of organization. There is a theme that weaves through these layers, which in retrospect I see has shaped my interest. It is the Darwinian approach of population thinking (1), based on the notion that species, categories, and even molecular interactions in living systems arise by selection acting over time on populations consisting of large numbers of variants. The idea that variation is not noise but is rather the substrate for the emergence of biological form and function provides an underlying theme that is central to and defining of what I have called the sciences of recognition. These include evolution itself, embryology (particularly morphogenesis), immunology, and the neurobiology of complex brains. In all these arenas, recognition at molecular, cellular, and organismal levels occurs through selective processes. In each case, the substrate is biochemical although the higher order rules are governed by variation and selection. I propose to tell a few anecdotes from my early experiences, particularly those that led to molecular immunology. I recount them to point out that scientists can have blind spots and occasionally forget the lesson that one must consider all the levels of organization that emerge from selective events.",2004,59,22,1,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
8041e95e0f4b63679ace8db108ff9cc839d1639a,Formation of high mass X-ray black hole binaries,"Abstract The discrepancy in the past years of many more black-hole soft X-ray transients (SXTs), of which a dozen have now been identified, had challenged accepted wisdom in black hole evolution. Reconstruction in the literature of high-mass X-ray binaries has required stars of up to ∼40 M ⊙ to evolve into low-mass compact objects, setting this mass as the limit often used for black hole formation in population syntheses. On the other hand, the sheer number of inferred SXTs requires that many, if not most, stars of ZAMS masses 20–35 M ⊙ end up as black holes ( Portegies Zwart et al., 1997 , Ergma and van den Heuvel, 1998 ). In this paper we show that this can be understood by challenging the accepted wisdom that the result of helium core burning in a massive star is independent of whether the core is covered by a hydrogen envelope, or ‘naked’ while it burns. The latter case occurs in binaries when the envelope of the more massive star is transferred to the companion by Roche Lobe overflow while in either main sequence or red giant stage. For solar metallicity, whereas the helium cores which burn while naked essentially never go into high-mass black holes, those that burn while clothed do so, beginning at ZAMS mass ∼20 M ⊙ , the precise mass depending on the 12C(α,γ)16O rate as we outline. In this way the SXTs can be evolved, provided that the H envelope of the massive star is removed only following the He core burning. Whereas this scenario was already outlined in 1998 by Brown et al. [NewA 4 (1999) 313], their work was based on evolutionary calculations of Woosley et al. [ApJ 448 (1995) 315] which employed wind loss rates which were too high. In this article we collect results for lower, more correct wind loss rates, finding that these change the results only little. We go into the details of carbon burning in order to reconstruct why the low Fe core masses from naked He stars are relatively insensitive to wind loss rate. The main reason is that without the helium produced by burning the hydrogen envelope, which is convected to the carbon in a clothed star, a central 12C abundance of ∼1/3 remains unburned in a naked star following He core burning. The later convective burning through 12C+12C reactions occurs at a temperature T∼80 keV. Finally, we show that in order to evolve a black hole of mass ≳10 M ⊙ such as observed in Cyg X-1 , even employing extremely massive progenitors of ZAMS mass ≳60 M ⊙ for the black hole, the core must be covered by hydrogen during a substantial fraction of the core burning. In other words, the progenitor must be a WNL star. We evolve Cyg X-1 in an analogous way to which the SXTs are evolved, the difference being that the companion in Cyg X-1 is more massive than those in the SXTs, so that Cyg X-1 shines continuously.",2001,32,66,3,4,5,6,2,2,4,5,3,0,4

A systematic investigation of this effect was performed by means of LEED, work function measurements and mass spectrometry. Our results combined with previous TDS work of other authors allowed proposal of a new model for the autocatalytic CO 2 peaks. Their occurrence can be explained by a simple vacancy model for the rate-limiting step of NO dissociation, if one takes into account the effect of island formation of the adsorbed phase. Since both adsorbates, NO and CO, lift the hex reconstruction, their coadsorption leads to the formation of mixed 1 × 1 islands with a constant local coverage.

Expression of synapsin III was observed in puncta throughout the brain, but demonstrated greater regional variation than that of synapsins I or II. This punctate staining is typical for synaptic vesicle proteins located at nerve terminals. These findings are also consistent with the well‐established role for synapsins in regulating neurotransmitter release. However, unexpectedly, synapsin III was also highly expressed in the cell body and processes of immature neurons in neurogenic regions of the adult brain, such as the hippocampal dentate gyrus, rostral migratory stream, and olfactory bulb. Many synapsin III‐positive neurons also reacted with an antibody directed toward polysialylated‐neuronal cell adhesion molecule, a marker of immature, migrating neurons. These results suggest that synapsin III may also play a role in adult neurogenesis. J. Comp. Neurol. 454:105–114, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",2002,42,51,2,0,1,4,3,2,1,4,4,5,5

The contaminant proteinase cleaves the alpha 1-PI component in the alpha 1-PI-chymotrypsinogen A complex close to its N-terminus, between threonine-11 and aspartate-12 and the chymotrypsinogen A part between tyrosine-146 and threonine-147. By this modification the complex becomes unstable and dissociates into modified alpha 1-PI and neo-chymotrypsinogen A. A tritium labelling experiment shows that the contaminant proteinase is present in a 0.5-1.0% (w/w) ratio in the inhibitor preparation. These experiments indicate that alpha 1-PI is not a temporary inhibitor for these enzymes, as assumed by other authors. Isolated modified alpha 1-PI can be crystallized as tetragonal bipyramides from 2.6M sodium potassium phosphate pH 8.0. The crystals are suitable for three dimensional X-ray structure analysis. In spite of the cleavage of the susceptible peptide bond by chymotrypsinogen A, the C-terminal 3.6 kDa cleavage peptide remains tightly bound to the inhibitor by means of non-covalent interactions. In accordance with the result of the known complete amino-acid sequence of the inhibitor this finding offers an alternative explanation to the suggestion of alpha 1-PI being a double headed inhibitor. Isolated neo-chymotrypsinogen A can be activated to active chymotrypsin and can form a very labile 1 : 1 complex with alpha 1-PI, which dissociates rapidly into inactive inhibitor and neo-chymotrypsinogen.",1982,12,25,0,0,1,3,5,1,1,1,0,1,0

That is, the number of electrons on the polymer backbone is constant while the number of protons is increased. We present here extensive magnetic, optical and transport data that demonstrate that the resulting emeraldine salt (ES) is metallic with a finite density of states at the Fermi energy. The results are consistent with segregation into fully protonated emeraldine salt and unprotonated emeraldine base polymer regions. it is proposed that the observed transition is an isolated bipolaron-to-polaron lattice transition. The correspondence of this concept to the disproportionation between protonated imine plus amine to form two semiquinones is shown.",1987,18,478,1,13,17,35,25,11,18,20,14,6,13

The isolated compounds were evaluated for their protective activities against PC12 cell injury induced by corticosterone (CORT) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine ion (MPP+), as well as inhibitory activities against BACE1. Compound 4, 5,6-dihydroxy-2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone (5), daphnauranol B (7), 6-methoxy-2-[2-(3-methyoxyphenyl)ethyl]chromone (10), isoagarotetrol (14), and 1-hydroxy-1,5-diphenylpentan-3-one (16) showed significant protective effects on CORT-induced injury in PC12 cells at a concentration of 20 μM (P < 0.001). Isoagarotetrol (14) showed a significant protective effect on MPP+-induced injury in PC12 cells at a concentration of 20 μM (P < 0.001), while compound 4 showed a moderate activity (P < 0.01).

The human Timeless exists in a tight complex with a smaller protein called Tipin (Timeless-interacting protein). Here we investigated the mechanism by which the Timeless-Tipin complex functions as a mediator in the ATR-Chk1 DNA damage checkpoint pathway. We find that the Timeless-Tipin complex specifically mediates Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR in response to DNA damage and replication stress through interaction of Tipin with the 34-kDa subunit of replication protein A (RPA). The Tipin-RPA interaction stabilizes Timeless-Tipin and Tipin-Claspin complexes on RPA-coated ssDNA and in doing so promotes Claspin-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR. Our results therefore indicate that RPA-covered ssDNA not only supports recruitment and activation of ATR but also, through Tipin and Claspin, it plays an important role in the action of ATR on its critical downstream target Chk1.",2010,70,105,6,5,14,13,11,11,8,10,15,4,2

The calculation shows that even‐numbered clusters tend to be singlets, as opposed to odd‐numbered clusters which are open shell systems. This is in agreement with the experimental observations of even/odd alternations of the electron affinity and ionization potential. In the larger clusters, the atoms prefer an alternating bond arrangement; charge transfers are observed from Ga sites to As sites. This observation is also in agreement with recent chemisorption studies of ammonia on GaAs clusters. The close agreement between theoretical calculations and experimental results, together with the rich variation of electronic properties of GaAs clusters with composition makes GaAs clusters an ideal prototype system for the study of how electronic structure influences chemical reactivity.",1991,33,73,2,2,1,5,4,3,2,4,7,3,4
ab04d7203fc37900d5ecc5daba6eddfc3e05aa3b,Analogs of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone with increased biological activity produced by D-amino acid substitutions in position 6.,"The incorporation of simple d-amino acids in place of glycine in position 6 of the LH-RH decapeptide produces analogs which have far greater gonadotropin-releasing activities in vivo and in vitro than the natural hormone. An investigation of the structural features of the d-amino acids responsible for this phenomenon suggests that an increase in the lipophilic character and perhaps the size and aromaticity of the side chain coincides with an increase in biological activity. This is demonstrated by the LH-releasing activities of the following series of peptides which were assayed over a period of 6 h in immature male rats: [d-Glu(6)]-,1.8;[d-Ala(6)]-,7.0;[d-Leu(6)]-,9,0;[d-Phe(6)]-,10;[d-Trp(6)]-LH-RH, 13 times more active than LH-RH itself. In contrast to previous results with [d-Ala(6)]-and [d-Leu(6)]-LH-RH, where the substitution of an ethylamide group for the glycine amide at the C-terminus produces large increases in LH/FSH releasing activity, the ethylamide derivatives of [d-Phe(6)]-and [d-Trp(6)]-LH-RH were actually less potent than their parent peptides. [(N-Me-d-Ala)(6)]-LH-RH was found to be approximately 70 times less active than [d-Ala(6)]-LH-RH which indicates that disruption of a preferred receptor-site binding conformation might be brought about by methylation of the amide linkage in this position.",1976,0,110,0,3,6,6,5,4,3,4,2,7,2

Under basal conditions normal adults have plasma concentrations of cyclic AMP ranging from 10 to 25 nmoles/liter and excrete from 1.5 to 5 mumoles of cyclic AMP per g of urinary creatinine. About one-half to two-thirds of the cyclic AMP excreted in the urine is derived from the plasma by glomerular filtration, and the remainder is produced by the kidney. Renal production of cyclic AMP is partly under the control of PTH. It can be suppressed by infusions of calcium and stimulated by infusions of the calcium chelating agent, EDTA. Infusions of PTH in doses up to 10 mU/kg per min were associated with dose-related increases both in urinary cyclic AMP and phosphate. Infusions of PTH in doses ranging from 20 to 80 mU/kg per min did not lead to any further increase in phosphaturia but did lead to further marked increases in urinary cyclic AMP. A modest increase in plasma cyclic AMP was noted when PTH was infused at 40 mU/kg per min. Anephric patients failed to show appreciable increases in plasma cyclic AMP in response to large doses of PTH but did show expected increases in response to glucagon. Surgical removal of parathyroid adenomas from nine patients with primary hyperparathyroidism was invariably followed by a decrease in urinary cyclic AMP, PTH, in large doses, and calcium infusion produced up to 2-fold increases in the other known naturally occurring cyclic nucleotide, guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP).",1970,25,248,2,2,4,9,8,16,15,22,18,16,14

In the present study, we demonstrated that overexpression of SKD1(E235Q) using an adenovirus delivery system caused a defect in autophagy-dependent bulk protein degradation. Morphological observations suggested that this inhibition of autophagy results from an impairment of autolysosome formation. SKD1(E235Q) overexpression also inhibited transport from endosomes to autophagosomes, an event normally occurring prior to fusion with lysosomes.

The hybridization creates pendular states in which the molecular axis is confined to librate over a limited angular range about the field direction. In this way substantial spatial alignment associated with large Zeeman shifts can be attained for many ground-state radicals or ions and electronically excited states of diatomic or linear molecules. The magnetic hybridization is analogous to that recently demonstrated for polar molecules in electric fields.

The root-mean-square differences of the backbone for the set of structures were shown to have the same variation with residue number as those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, normal mode analyses and X-ray B-factors. This supports the idea that observed structural changes provide a measure of the inherent flexibility of the protein, although specific interactions between the protease and the ligand play a secondary role. The results suggest that the potential energy surface of the HIV-1 protease is characterized by many local minima with small energetic differences, some of which are sampled by the different X-ray structures of the HIV-1 protease complexes. Interdomain correlated motions were calculated from the structural fluctuations and the results were also in agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses.

Here we describe that activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and in Mono Mac 6 cells leads to activation of downstream kinases, which can subsequently phosphorylate 5-LO in vitro. Different agents activated the 5-LO kinase activities, including stimuli for cellular leukotriene biosynthesis (A23187, thapsigargin, N-formyl-leucyl-phenylalanine), compounds that up-regulate the capacity for leukotriene biosynthesis (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor), and well known p38 stimuli as sodium arsenite and sorbitol. For all stimuli, 5-LO kinase activation was counteracted by SB203580 (3 microM or less), an inhibitor of p38 kinase. At least two p38-dependent 5-LO kinase activities were found. Based on migration properties in in-gel kinase assays and immunoreactivity, one of these was identified as mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP kinase 2). The other appeared to be MAPKAP kinase 3; however, it could not be excluded that also other p38-dependent kinases contributed. When polymorphonuclear leukocytes were incubated with sodium arsenite (strong activator of 5-LO kinases), platelet-activating factor and exogenous AA, there was a 4-fold increase in 5-LO activity as compared with incubations with only platelet-activating factor and AA.

At 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed to evaluate tumor burden and metastases.ResultsMice in the WLR group had larger primary tumors than mice in the FGS group at termination [1.72 g ± standard error (SE) 0.58 vs. 0.25 g ± SE 0.14; respectively, p = 0.026). Mean disease-free survival was significantly lengthened from 5.33 weeks in the WLR group to 7.38 weeks in the FGS group (p = 0.02). Recurrence rates were lower in the FGS group than in the WLR group (38 vs. 73 %; p = 0.049). This translated into lower local and distant recurrence rates for FGS compared to WLR (31 vs. 67 for local recurrence, respectively, and 25 vs. 60 % for distant recurrence, respectively). Metastatic tumor burden was significantly greater in the WLR group than in the FGS group (96.92 mm2 ± SE 52.03 vs. 2.20 mm2 ± SE 1.43; respectively, χ2 = 5.455; p = 0.02).ConclusionsRACPPs can accurately and effectively label pancreatic cancer for effective FGS, resulting in better postresection outcomes than for WLR surgery.",2014,33,47,0,0,8,11,6,11,7,3,1,0,0

These blasts express relatively stable morphological, enzymatic and antigenic phenotypes which may largely represent the normal gene products of the corresponding precursor cells1–4. A number of findings support these suggestions. The phenotype of the common form of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (cALL) corresponds to the phenotype of normal small non-T, non-B cells of lymphoid morphology detected in low numbers in the normal and regenerating infant bone marrow4,5. Also, the phenotype of blast cells in Thy-ALL corresponds approximately to that of cortical thymocytes or their immediate precursors6–9. Leukaemia-specific (virus-induced or mutant) changes or aberrant expression of normal gene products may also occur in leukaemia. To describe such phenomena, detailed single cell studies comparing leukaemic cells with their appropriate normal (frequently very rare) counterparts are needed. In this study we have performed such a comparative study and find that the human Thy-ALL blasts express unexpectedly high amounts of HLA-A, -B and -C antigens: the sensitive single cell assays used failed to find normal cells (in infant and fetal thymus, and in bone marrow) which express the exact phenotype of Thy-ALL blasts.",1980,13,31,0,0,7,8,4,3,1,1,2,0,0

D) and protein synthesis (cycloheximide, CH) on induction of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens by the tumour promoter TPA and by EBV superinfection has been analysed. The data indicate that (i) concomitant treatment of cells with Act. D and TPA leads to complete suppression of virus antigen induction. Subsequent treatment of the cells with Act. D after prior exposure to TPA results in some virus antigen induction, the amount depending on the time of TPA treatment. (ii) Simultaneous treatment of the cells with TPA and CH blocks antigen expression completely. Removal of the inhibitor results in antigen expression at a comparable rate to that of CH-untreated cells. (iii) If Ch treatment is followed by addition of Act. D, virus antigen induction by TPA is completely inhibited. In contrast, superinfection of the cells with P3HR-1 EBV in the presence of CH for the same period followed by removal of the inhibitor and addition of Act. D leads to virus antigen expression by 3 h after Act. D addition. (iv) Concomitant treatment with CH and TPA followed by addition of either iododeoxyuridine or n-butyric acid results in 'superinduction'. Virtually all cells exhibit EBV-specified antigens. This implies that induction of virus antigens by tumour promoters requires the synthesis of a specific RNA, that this RNA increases in concentration during the induction period and that the same RNA is not required for EBV transcription after exogenous infection.",1980,21,16,1,1,2,1,3,3,3,1,0,0,0
75a0609f323a35811b183f565bc0b4fe4a1b516d,Cotransformation and gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells.,"We have investigated cotransformation in mammalian cells and its potential for identifying cells that have been modified by gene targeting. Selectable genes on separate DNA fragments were simultaneously introduced into cells by coelectroporation. When the introduced fragments were scored for random integration, 75% of the transformed cells integrated both fragments within the genome of the same cell. When one of the cointroduced fragments was scored for integration at a specific locus by gene targeting, only 4% of the targeted cells cointegrated the second fragment. Apparently, cells that have been modified by gene targeting with one DNA fragment rarely incorporate a second DNA fragment. Despite this limitation, we were able to use the cotransformation protocol to identify targeted cells by screening populations of colonies that had been transformed with a cointroduced selectable gene. When hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) targeting DNA was coelectroporated with a selectable neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene into embryonic stem (ES) cells, hprt-targeted colonies were isolated from the population of neo transformants at a frequency of 1 per 70 G418-resistant colonies. In parallel experiments with the same targeting construct, hprt-targeted cells were found at a frequency of 1 per 5,500 nonselected colonies. Thus, an 80-fold enrichment for targeted cells was observed within the population of colonies transformed with the cointroduced DNA compared with the population of nonselected colonies. This enrichment for targeted cells after cotransformation should be useful in the isolation of colonies that contain targeted but nonselectable gene alterations.",1991,22,72,2,1,3,6,6,4,1,4,2,4,4

Forward-convolution fitting of our data reveals the formation of diacetylene, HCCCCH, in its X1Σg+ electronic ground state.

These problems prevented the development of nitride-based devices for many years. In 1986, a dramatic improvement in the crystalline quality of GaN was achieved by use of low-temperature-deposited (LT) buffer layer technology in metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. In 1989, the high quality GaN enabled us to produce p-type conduction in nitrides and to control the conductivity of n-type nitrides. These achievements led to the invention of the world's first GaN p–n junction blue/UV LED in 1989. Room temperature UV stimulated emission, which is indispensable for laser operation, was also achieved in 1990 by use of high quality GaN films grown with the LT-buffer layers. These breakthroughs inspired nitride researchers around the world to greater efforts, and eventually led to the commercialization of high-performance blue LEDs and long-life violet LDs as well as the development of nitride-based devices such as high-speed transistors. Furthermore, unique properties such as a large piezoelectric effect were also clarified due to the marked improvements in crystal quality of nitrides. In this paper, key inventions during the development of nitride-based blue LED and LD are reviewed and a recent advance in UV devices is also described.",2007,52,87,3,1,7,4,12,6,5,6,11,8,4

78dc00808c4b19a82354ccd739f6d8bb7a76953e,Making more synapses: a way to store information?,"Abstract. Although information may be stored in the brain as changes in the strength of existing synapses, formation of new synapses has long been thought of as an additional substrate for memory storage. The identification of subcellular structural changes following learning in mammals poses a serious ‘needle-in-the-haystack’ problem. In most attempts to demonstrate structural plasticity during learning, animals have been exposed for prolonged periods to complex environments, where they are confronted with a variety of sensory, motor and spatial challenges throughout the exposure period. These environments are thought to promote several forms of learning. Repeated exposure to such environments has been shown to increase the density of spines and dendritic complexity in relevant brain structures. The number of neurons has also been reported to increase in some areas. It is not clear, however, whether the new synapses emerging from these forms of plasticity mediate specific information storage, or whether they reflect a more general sophistication of the excited parts of the network.",1999,69,72,4,0,1,3,3,5,3,3,6,3,6

The inhibition of binding of the radiolabeled glycoproteins to CD4+ cells by increasing concentrations of nonradiolabeled gp160 or gp140 was used to determine the affinity of the interaction between the glycoproteins and CD4. The gp-CD4 association occurs with a high affinity: K0.5 gpHIV-1 = 9 x 10(-9) M and K0.5 gpHIV-2 = 7 x 10(-8) M, indicating that the affinity of the interaction between HIV-2 gp140 and CD4 is 10 times lower than that observed with HIV-1 gp160. The N-linked glycans of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 glycoproteins account for a high proportion of their molecular mass (about 50%). Total deglycosylation of gp160 and gp140 by enzymatic treatment with Endo F-N glycanase occurred under nondenaturing conditions, indicating the high accessibility of the N-linked glycan chains in the three-dimensional structure of the molecule. Moreover, the deglycosylated proteins retained a significant binding capacity to CD4. These results show that the carbohydrate chains of HIV-2 gp140, as those of HIV-1 gp160, do not play a major role in the gp-CD4 interaction.",1992,39,29,1,0,4,2,1,1,4,2,0,0,1

We removed additional sequences from PrP106 and identified a 61-residue peptide, designated PrP61, that spontaneously adopted a protease-resistant conformation in neuroblastoma cells. Synthetic PrP61 bearing a carboxy-terminal lipid moiety polymerized into protease-resistant, β-sheet-enriched amyloid fibrils at a physiological salt concentration. Transgenic mice expressing low levels of PrP61 died spontaneously with ataxia. Neuropathological examination revealed accumulation of protease-resistant PrP61 within neuronal dendrites and cell bodies, apparently causing apoptosis.

Binding of LDL to these receptors was followed by internalization of the lipoprotein and hydrolysis of its protein and cholesteryl ester components. Cultured lymphocytes from a patient with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia lacked cell surface LDL receptors and therefore failed to take up and degrade the lipoprotein with high affinity. Cultured human lymphocytes should prove useful for further studies of: (a) the relation between cholesterol metabolism and cellular function and (b) the mechanism by which LDL binding at the cell surface leads to internalization of the lipoprotein.",1976,27,100,0,1,7,11,4,6,11,9,2,1,6

Results of protein modelling and saturated site-directed mutagenesis at position 133 and 209 have been reported in a previous paper (Declerck et al., 1995, Prot. Engng, 8, 1029-1037). In the first part of the present work, evidence is presented supporting the hypothesis that the stabilizing mutations reduce the rate of initial unfolding of the enzyme during the reversible step of the inactivation reaction and do not modify the irreversible processes undergone subsequently by the unfolded molecules. In the second part, we have examined the three-dimensional structure of BLA which has been determined recently by X-ray analysis (Machius et al., 1995, J. Mol. Biol., 246, 545-559). This analysis showed that our previous predictions made from molecular modelling were partly correct. At position 209, the effect of the stabilizing substitutions can be explained by a groove-filling effect reinforcing the hydrophobic packing between two helices of the central domain, while preserving a well-ordered water structure at the surface. At position 133, the stabilizing substitutions must compensate the loss of the hydrogen bond network in which the original histidine side-chain is involved; this compensation could be achieved through enhanced hydrophobic side-chain interactions within the beta-sheet where residue 133 is located, which correlates with the propensity of the residue to form and maintain a beta-strand conformation of the main chain at this position.",1997,0,91,2,0,5,2,7,7,2,7,1,6,8

Recent studies disclosed a protein network that controls the level of one lipid-cholesterol. This network resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A key component is Scap, a tetrameric ER membrane protein that binds cholesterol. Cholesterol binding prevents Scap from transporting SREBPs to the Golgi for activation. Using a new method to purify ER membranes from cultured cells, we show that Scap responds cooperatively to ER cholesterol levels. When ER cholesterol exceeds 5% of total ER lipids (molar basis), SREBP-2 transport is abruptly blocked. Transport resumes when ER cholesterol falls below the 5% threshold. The 5% threshold is lowered to 3% when cells overexpress Insig-1, a Scap-binding protein. Cooperative interactions between cholesterol, Scap, and Insig create a sensitive switch that controls the cholesterol composition of cell membranes with remarkable precision.",2008,48,398,19,1,22,22,28,30,32,23,27,38,36

One layer of the particles is imbedded within the oxide layer in an ordinary tunnel junction. The average radius of the small particles has been determined directly from electron micrographs. Most of the electrons which flow across the junction will tunnel into and out of one of the imbedded particles. The current-voltage characteristic of such a junction changes markedly when the particles go from the normal to the superconducting state. From this change we have determined the energy gap, the transition temperature, and the critical field in small particles with radius of no more than 25 A. The energy gap and the transition temperature are slightly larger than the bulk values for Sn particles, while the critical field is much larger than would be predicted from simple theories.",1971,24,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

At low temperatures we find torque curves which are nearly reversible and which can be accounted for by a uniaxial anisotropy. The anisotropy axis is movable and so the anisotropy is a memory effect similar to that found in Cu-Mn alloys. The macroscopic anisotropy is uniaxial in nature for rotation about a single axis as expected since the microscopic anisotropy is uniaxial. For rotation about more than one axis our results are consistent with a triad anisotropy.,1989,0,6,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0

In this unique mutant strain (derived from subject J.D.), the cell surface receptor for plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) was able to bind 125I-labeled LDL normally, but internalization of the receptor-bound lipoprotein failed to occur. Thus the defect in this strain differed from the defects found in the fibroblasts from the other 21 FH homozygote strains in which the binding of 125I-LDL to the receptor was either absent (receptor-negative) or markedly reduced (receptor-defective). The LDL receptor in the J.D. cells exhibited first, normal kinetics of high affinity binding at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C; second, normal specificity (affinity for LDL more than 200 fold greater than for HDL); third, normal susceptibility to feed-back suppression by 25-hydroxycholesterol plus cholesterol; and fourth, a normal rate of turnover when the cells were treated with cycloheximide. Despite its normal ability to bind 125I-LDL, the LDL receptor in the J.D. cells failed to transport its LDL into the cell, and degradation of the lipoprotein in cellular lysosomes therefore did not occur. As a result, the lipoprotein did not suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity; nor did it activate cholesteryl ester formation. A phenocopy of the internalization defect in the J.D. cells could be created by incubation of normal fibroblasts with N-ethyl maleimide, an agent that did not affect 125I-LDL binding to the receptor but blocked its subsequent internalization by the cell. The current data indicate that at least two gene products are necessary for the adsorptive endocytosis of LDL: one that is required for the binding of the lipoprotein, and one that promotes the internalization of the receptor-bound ligand.",1976,25,186,2,1,5,7,8,8,8,8,8,9,11

Whereas all previously reported B-DNA dodecamers have crystallized isomorphously (spacegroup P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions of a = 24.5 A, b = 40.3 A, c = 65.9 A), the duplex reported here crystallizes in a different lattice (spacegroup P2(1)2(1)2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 44.8 A, b = 66.1 A, c = 42.9 A). The DNA exhibits a 30 degree bend in the helix axis that is 180 degrees away from the 20 degree bend exhibited by the adenine tract DNA crystal structures that have been previously determined. This bend is 90 degrees away from the bend predicted for an adenine tract by solution and gel experiments. The adenine tract is straight and bending occurs in the G+C-rich regions. Comparison of the various adenine tract DNA crystal structures reveals that in all cases the adenine tracts have nearly identical structures, even though the overall bends of the helix axes are quite different. This implies that the structure of the adenine tract is robust, at least under the conditions of crystallization. The base-pairs in the adenine tracts exhibit a large propeller twist that leads to the formation of bifurcated hydrogen bonds and a narrow minor groove. In the crystal structure of d(CGCGAAAAAACG)/d(CGTTTTTTCGCG), a minor groove spine of hydration is observed that probably stabilizes the straight structure of the adenine tract. This straight structure of the A-tract is not consistent with the results of fiber diffraction, gel experiments, and NMR studies. Although this may imply that the results of solution experiments need to be reinterpreted, the conditions under which the crystals were grown are different from those under which the solution experiments were done. The possibility remains that the 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol necessary for crystal growth may facilitate formation of the spine of hydration that stabilizes the straight A-tract, although recent NMR results show the presence of the spine of hydration in aqueous solution. We have also extended our previously reported observation that non-self-complementary DNA structures can exist in the crystal lattice in two orientations. A dodecamer brominated on one strand provides experimental evidence that d(CGCAAAAAAGCG)/d(CGCTTTTTTG CG) is positioned in two orientations in the crystal lattice that are related by a 180 degree rotation around the pseudo-dyad axis of the sequence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1993,0,115,3,1,4,4,7,11,8,17,6,8,7
be2e1f3322a3c548924471ccd77aba38aef3ba0d,Molecular gauge blocks for building on the nanoscale.,"Molecular gauge blocks, based on 1-7, 9-11 paraxylene rings, have been synthesized as part of a homologous series of oligoparaxylenes (OPXs) with a view to providing a molecular tool box for the construction of nano architectures-such as spheres, cages, capsules, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), metal-organic polyhedrons (MOPs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), to name but a few-of well-defined sizes and shapes. Twisting between the planes of contiguous paraxylene rings is generated by the steric hindrance associated with the methyl groups and leads to the existence of soluble molecular gauge blocks without the need, at least in the case of the lower homologues, to introduce long aliphatic side chains onto the phenylene rings in the molecules. Although soluble molecular gauge blocks with up to seven consecutive benzenoid rings have been prepared employing repeating paraxylene units, in the case of the higher homologues it becomes necessary to introduce hexyl groups instead of methyl groups onto selected phenylene rings to maintain solubility. A hexyl-doped compound with seven substituted phenylene rings was found to be an organogelator, exhibiting thermally reversible gelation and a critical gelation concentration of 10 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide. Furthermore, control over the morphology of a series of hexyl-doped OPXs to give microfibers, microaggregates, or nanofibers, was observed as a function of their lengths according to images obtained by scanning electron microscopy. The modular syntheses of the paraphenylene derivatives rely heavily on Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. The lack of π-π conjugation in these derivatives that is responsible for their enhanced solubilities was corroborated by UV/Vis and fluorescent spectroscopy. In one particular series of model OPXs, dynamic (1)H NMR spectroscopy was used to probe the stereochemical consequences of having from one up to five axes of chirality present in the same molecule. The Losanitsch sequence for the compounds with 1-3 chiral axes was established, and a contemporary mathematical way was found to describe the sequence. The development of the ways and means to make molecular gauge building blocks will have positive repercussions on the control of nanostructures in general. Their incorporation into extended structures with the MOF-74 topology provides an excellent demonstration of the potential usefulness of these molecular gauge blocks.",2012,148,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,3,1,0

In cholesterol-depleted cells, Scap transports sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) to the Golgi, where the active fragment of SREBP is liberated by proteases so that it can activate genes for cholesterol synthesis. When ER cholesterol increases, Scap binds cholesterol, and this changes the conformation of cytosolic Loop 6, which contains the binding site for COPII proteins. The altered conformation precludes COPII binding, abrogating movement to the Golgi. Consequently, cholesterol synthesis declines. Here, we identify the cholesterol-binding site on Scap as Loop 1, a 245-amino acid sequence that projects into the ER lumen. Recombinant Loop 1 binds sterols with a specificity identical to that of the entire Scap membrane domain. When tyrosine 234 in Loop 1 is mutated to alanine, Loop 6 assumes the cholesterol-bound conformation, even in sterol-depleted cells. As a result, full-length Scap(Y234A) cannot mediate SREBP processing in transfected cells. These results indicate that luminal Loop 1 of Scap controls the conformation of cytosolic Loop 6, thereby determining whether cells produce cholesterol.",2011,35,64,4,3,4,8,5,5,8,5,4,5,8

Toward elucidating the molecular language of prion protein (PrP) conformations, we produced an array of recombinant PrP amyloids with varying conformational stabilities. In mice, the most stable amyloids produced the most stable prion strains that exhibited the longest incubation times, whereas more labile amyloids generated less stable strains and shorter incubation times. The direct relationship between stability and incubation time of prion strains suggests that labile prions are more fit, in that they accumulate more rapidly and thus kill the host faster. Although incubation times can be changed by altering the PrP expression level, PrP sequence, prion dose, or route of inoculation, we report here the ability to modify the incubation time predictably in mice by modulating the prion conformation.",2009,56,193,14,2,28,24,19,25,27,19,11,10,9

In this paper, these results are summarized. A water jet experiment simulating Li flow validated stable flow up to 20 m/s with a double reducer nozzle. In addition, a small Li loop experiment validated stable Li flow up to 14 m/s. To control the nitrogen content in Li below 10 wppm will require surface area of a V–Ti alloy getter of 135 m 2 . Conceptual designs of diagnostics have been carried out. Moreover, the concept of a remote handling system to replace the back wall based on `cut and reweld' and `bayonet' options has been established. Analysis by FMEA showed safe operation of the target system. Recent activities in the transition phase, started in 2003, and plan for the next phase are also described.",2004,5,15,0,1,3,0,0,0,1,0,2,1,1

They are the only proteins known to interact directly with the motor domain. To gain more insight into UCS function, we determined the atomic structure of the yeast UCS protein, She4p, at 2.9 Å resolution. We found that 16 helical repeats are organized into an L-shaped superhelix with an amphipathic N-terminal helix dangling off the short arm of the L-shaped molecule. In the crystal, She4p forms a 193-Å-long, zigzag-shaped dimer through three distinct and evolutionary conserved interfaces. We have identified She4p’s C-terminal region as a ligand for a 27-residue-long epitope on the myosin motor domain. Remarkably, this region consists of two adjacent, but distinct, binding epitopes localized at the nucleotide-responsive cleft between the nucleotide- and actin-filament-binding sites. One epitope is situated inside the cleft, the other outside the cleft. After ATP hydrolysis and Pi ejection, the cleft narrows at its base from 20 to 12 Å thereby occluding the inside the cleft epitope, while leaving the adjacent, outside the cleft binding epitope accessible to UCS binding. Hence, one cycle of higher and lower binding affinity would accompany one ATP hydrolysis cycle and a single step in the walk on an actin filament rope. We propose that a UCS dimer links two myosins at their motor domains and thereby functions as one of the determinants for step size of myosin on actin filaments.",2010,27,43,7,0,5,5,4,9,4,2,3,1,2

They have been characterized as globular particles, reminiscent of folded proteins, by cryo-TEM, LS, DOSY NMR, and SANS studies. The reversible polymers obtained show remarkably low dispersity and feature double covalent dynamics allowing for fine-tuning of both exchange and incorporation processes through pH control. In the course of build-up, they perform a selection of the most suitable building block, as indicated by the preferential incorporation of the more hydrophobic amino-acid component with increased rate and higher molecular weight of the polymer formed.

6ab5080dd5b7d91b31caa2811c95eadd6f80d7ec,"Mind-brain interaction: Mentalism, yes; dualism, no","Abstract A traditional working hypothesis in neuroscience holds that a complete account of brain function is possible, in principle, in strictly neurophysiological terms without invoking conscious or mental agents; the neural correlates of subjective experience are conceived to exert causal influence but not mental qualities per se . This long established materialist-behaviorist principle has been challenged in recent years by the introduction of a modified concept of the mind-brain relation in which consciousness is conceived to be emergent and causal. Psychophysical interaction is explained in terms of the emergence in nesting brain hierarchies of high order, functionally derived, mental properties that interact by laws and principles different from, and not reducible to those of neurophysiology. Reciprocal upward and downward, interlevel determination of the mental and neural action is accounted for on these terms without violating the principles of scientific explanation and without reducing the qualities of inner experience to those of physiology. Interaction of mind and brain becomes not only conceivable and scientifically tenable, but more plausible in some respects than were the older parallelist and identity views of the materialist position. This revised concept of consciousness as causal, with its recognition of mental phenomena as explanatory constructs in science, has brought a marked change during the past decade in the scientific status of consciousness and of mental and cognitive phenomena generally. Resultant mehtalist trends within science have been accompanied also by a corollary rise in acceptance of various mentalist-related concepts and dualist beliefs in the supernatural, the paranormal and in unembodied forms of conscious existence that receive no logical support from the new mind-brain concepts of neuroscience. Reasons are advanced to show that our latest mind-brain model is fundamentally monistic and not only fails to support dualism, but serves to further discount fading prospects for finding dualist forms or domains of conscious experience not embodied in a functioning brain.",1980,41,227,3,2,4,30,3,3,26,4,4,6,2

The effect of local constraints on junctions,"The effects of restrictions on the fluctuations of network junctions imposed by neighboring chains are treated by resort to a model in which these restrictions are represented by domains of constraint. Whereas in a phantom network devoid of such constraints the displacements of junctions from their mean positions are invariant with strain, involvements with neighbors in a real network render them dependent on the strain. The observed stress consequently is increased above predictions for the equivalent phantom network. On the plausible assumption that the dimensions of the domains are transformed linearly (affinely) by the macroscopic strain, the constraints become less restrictive in the direction of a principal extension λt with increase in λt. Hence, the relative enhancement of the stress diminishes with the strain. The characteristic departures of the observed tension (f) –extension (α) curve for elongation from the expression f∝kT (α−α−2) of previous molecular theories are qualitatively reproduced by...",1977,27,333,3,0,2,13,8,10,10,5,7,11,9

Thymidine kinase activity was expressed even when the promoter and terminator sequences for tk RNA synthesis were retained.

Splicing of apparent intervening sequences in the tk gene was also observed. When the orientation of the tk promoter was opposite to the promoter in the long terminal repeat, virus synthesis was diminished, whereas thymidine kinase activity was expressed at an elevated level compared with virus in which the promoter was in the same orientation. However, when the apparent tk promoter was deleted from virus with the tk gene in the opposite orientation, a high level of virus synthesis was observed, probably as a result of absence of interference of RNA synthesis from converging promoters.

In benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue, the ratio of stromal to epithelial cells reaches a 5:1 ratio. In this study, we evaluated the effects of crossover conditioned media (CM) of stromal and epithelial prostate cells before and after treatment with LHRH antagonist Cetrorelix. WPMY-1 human prostate stromal cells and BPH-1 human benign prostatic hyperplasia cells were cultured in vitro and the effects of crossover conditioned media (CM) from those cells were studied. We evaluated the effect of Cetrorelix on the expression of PCNA and p53 in those cells. We then studied the effect of Cetrorelix on BPH-1 cells cultured with the CM from WPMY-1 cells, as well as the mechanisms which govern these interactions. CM from WPMY-1 cells strongly stimulated the proliferation of BPH-1 cells in a dose dependent manner, while CM from BPH-1 cells only slightly increased the proliferation of WPMY-1 cells. Cetrorelix inhibited the proliferation of both cell lines and the expression of PCNA, while the expression of p53 was increased. Cetrorelix also inhibited the proliferation of BPH-1 cells stimulated with the CM from WPMY-1 cells. In the crossover experiment, conditioned media from WPMY-1 and BPH-1 cells increased the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and STAT3.

But what about fluid dynamics at the nanometer scale? Lorenz and Zewail used an electron microscope with nanosecond time resolution to capture images of molten lead flowing through a nanotube. They flash-melted the metal with a laser pulse to begin their flow measurements at a precise time point. The experiments offered insights into viscous friction as well as heat-transfer dynamics in a channel one-thousandth as wide as a strand of hair. Science, this issue p. 1496 Flash melting of lead in the core of a nanotube enables close tracking of nanometer-scale fluid dynamics. Nanofluidics involves the study of fluid transport in nanometer-scale structures. We report the direct observation of fluid dynamics in a single zinc oxide nanotube with the high spatial and temporal resolution of four-dimensional (4D) electron microscopy. The nanotube is filled with metallic lead, which we melt in situ with a temperature jump induced by a heating laser pulse. We then use a short electron pulse to create an image of the ensuing dynamics of the hot liquid. Single-shot images elucidate the mechanism of irreversible processes, whereas stroboscopic diffraction patterns provide the heating and cooling rates of single nanotubes.

B-Phycoerythrin consists of three different subunits forming an (alpha beta)6 gamma aggregate. The three-dimensional structure of the (alpha beta)6 hexamer was solved by Patterson search techniques using the molecular model of C-phycocyanin from Fremyella diplosiphon. The asymmetric unit of the crystal cell (space group P3, with a = b = 111.2 A, c = 59.9 A, alpha = beta = 90 degrees, gamma = 120 degrees) contains two (alpha beta) monomers related by a local dyad. Three asymmetric units are arranged around the crystallographic 3-fold axis building an (alpha beta)6 hexamer, as in C-phycocyanin. The crystal structure has been refined by energy-restrained crystallographic refinement and model building. The conventional R-factor of the final model was 18.9% with data to 2.2 A resolution. The molecular structures of the alpha and beta-subunits resemble those of C-phycocyanin. Major changes in comparison to phycocyanin are caused by deletion or insertion of segments involved in protein-chromophore interactions.

818c4437ca90cfdd01e231ab0d1a0a68a81db6ca,Bidirectional Regulation of Hippocampal Long-Term Synaptic Plasticity and Its Influence on Opposing Forms of Memory,"Reference memory characterizes the long-term storage of information acquired through numerous trials. In contrast, working memory represents the short-term acquisition of trial-unique information. A number of studies in the rodent hippocampus have focused on the contribution of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) to long-term reference memory. In contrast, little is known about the synaptic plasticity correlates of hippocampal-based components of working memory. Here, we described a mouse with selective expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) only in two regions of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus and area CA1. This mouse showed a deficit in several forms of LTP in both hippocampal subregions and a lowered threshold for the consolidation of long-term synaptic depression (LTD). When trained with one trial per day in a water maze task, mutant mice displayed a deficit in consolidation of long-term memory. In contrast, these mice proved to be more flexible after a transfer test and also showed a delay-dependent increased performance in working memory, when repetitive information (proactive interference) was presented. We suggest that through its bidirectional control over synaptic plasticity PKA can regulate opposing forms of memory. The defect in L-LTP disrupts long-term memory consolidation. The persistence of LTD may allow acquisition of new information by restricting the body of previously stored information and suppressing interference.",2010,94,99,4,4,6,11,13,12,11,5,15,6,2

Different reaction chamber configurations were studied. CH 4 /H 2 /Xe(Ar) and CH 4 /CO 2 /H 2 /Ar gas mixtures at total pressure 1.0–4.5 atm were used. Both convection and directed gas flows with velocity up to 50 cm/s delivered reactants to the substrate surface. Diamond film deposition rates up to 40–50 μm/h were reached. CW CO 2 laser beam power and intensity needed for a stationary plasma maintenance under various experimental conditions were found. Laser radiation absorption in plasma was measured. The possibility to combine laser plasma with an auxiliary electrical discharge is demonstrated. A comparison between laser and other plasma CVD techniques is made.,2001,10,10,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

We found unbalanced synthesis of HLA heavy chains and beta 2-microglobulin, the latter being in excess and secreted to the extracellular medium. In DAUDI cells, which are defective in beta 2-microglobulin, no HLA-A,B,C could be detected intracellularly even in the presence of added beta 2-microglobulin. Treatment of BRI-8 cells with tunicamycin, an antibiotic which inhibits glycosylation of polypeptides, almost had no effect on the levels of beta 2-microglobulin, while it markedly decreased that of HLA heavy chains, both on the cell surface and intracellularly. Glycosylation of the HLA heavy chains appeared to be an essential requirement for the normal expression of HLA-A,B,C antigens. The translation in vitro in a messenger-dependent reticulocyte system with total polysomes obtained from BRI-8 cells showed that beta 2-microglobulin was synthesized as a precursor.

That the co-units are distributed approximately at random was assured by analysis of the composition of the unreacted monomers, and by analysis of fractions separated from one of the copolymers by column fractionation. The copolymers were crystallized by stepwise cooling in small intervals over the crystallization range, each temperature being maintained for a period of two days. Melting was followed dilatometrically by raising the temperature in increments according to a similar schedule. Degrees of crystallinity calculated from the specific volume at each temperature are compared with the equilibrium theory of crystallization of copolymers. The comparison involves a single arbitrary parameter, from which we calculate an interfacial free energy of 170 ergs cm −2 (4 600 cal mole −1 of emerging chains) for the 001 face. The range over which melting is most marked shifts to lower temperatures with increase in the proportion of co-unit as expected, and in a manner accountable by the theory. For a given copolymer, however, the melting is restricted to a narrower temperature range than that predicted. At temperatures far below the melting point T m , the extent of crystallization fails to rise to the level predicted by theory, owing presumably to restraints imposed by involvement of the longer methylene sequences of the copolymer molecules in crystals formed at higher temperatures. As the melting point is approached, the degree of crystallinity falls to zero more rapidly than the equilibrium theory prescribes. This general observation is attributed to the kinetic difficulty of bringing together the comparatively sparse long methylene sequences required for crystallites which are stable near T m . Copolymers in which R = CH 3 melt, and crystallize, at higher temperatures than those for which R = C 2 H 5 and n- C 3 H 7 . This fact, in conjunction with the melting point/composition relationship for low proportions of the co-unit, indicates the formation of a crystalline phase which is a solid solution of  CH  dispersed among  CH 2  units. In copolymers of the larger co-units formation of a pure phase is indicated under the experimental conditions here employed.",1963,26,165,1,2,6,7,3,2,2,8,3,3,4

The first group is heterozygous for βARK1 gene ablation, βARK1(+/−), and the second is not only heterozygous for βARK1 gene ablation but is also transgenic for cardiac-specific overexpression of a βARK1 COOH-terminal inhibitor peptide, βARK1(+/−)/βARKct. In contrast to the embryonic lethal phenotype of the homozygous βARK1 knockout (Jaber, M., Koch, W. J., Rockman, H. A., Smith, B., Bond, R. A., Sulik, K., Ross, J., Jr., Lefkowitz, R. J., Caron, M.

Cardiac catheterization was performed in mice and showed a stepwise increase in contractile function in the βARK1(+/−) and βARK1(+/−)/βARKct mice with the greatest level observed in the βARK1(+/−)/βARKct animals. Contractile parameters were measured in adult myocytes isolated from both groups of gene-targeted animals. A significantly greater increase in percent cell shortening and rate of cell shortening following isoproterenol stimulation was observed in the βARK1(+/−) and βARK1(+/−)/βARKct myocytes compared with wild-type cells, indicating a progressive increase in intrinsic contractility. These data demonstrate that contractile function can be modulated by the level of βARK1 activity. This has important implications in disease states such as heart failure (in which βARK1 activity is increased) and suggests that βARK1 should be considered as a therapeutic target in this situation. Even partial inhibition of βARK1 activity enhances β-adrenergic receptor signaling leading to improved functional catecholamine responsiveness.",1998,24,176,3,0,20,13,9,3,14,15,8,7,12

We screened 29 wild-born Cameroonian chimpanzees and found that three (Cam3, Cam4, and Cam5) were positive for HIV-1 by Western blotting. Mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that Cam3 and Cam5 belonged to Pan troglodytes troglodytes and that Cam4 belonged to P. t. vellerosus. Genetic analyses of the viruses together with serological data demonstrated that at least one of the two P. t. troglodytes chimpanzees (Cam5) was infected in the wild, and revealed a horizontal transmission between Cam3 and Cam4. These data confirm that P. t. troglodytes is a natural host for HIV-1-related viruses. Furthermore, they show that SIVcpz can be transmitted in captivity, from one chimpanzee subspecies to another. All three SIVcpz-cam viruses clustered with HIV-1 N inenv. The full Cam3 SIVcpz genome sequence showed a very close phylogenetic relationship with SIVcpz-US, a virus identified in aP. t. troglodytes chimpanzee captured nearly 40 years earlier. Like SIVcpz-US, SIVcpz-cam3 was closely related to HIV-1 N inenv, but not in pol, supporting the hypothesis that HIV-1 N results from a recombination event. SIVcpz from chimpanzees born in the wild in Cameroon are thus strongly related inenv to HIV-1 N from Cameroon, demonstrating the geographic coincidence of these human and simian viruses and providing a further strong argument in favor of the origin of HIV-1 being in chimpanzees.",2000,24,180,16,15,16,19,12,14,14,16,9,10,3

Four primary dissociation pathways--elimination of atomic F, atomic H, molecular HF, and molecular H2--are identified at 157 nm. Dissociation to C2H3 + F is first observed in the present work. Decomposition of internally hot C2H3 and C2H2F occurs spontaneously. The barrier heights of CH2CH --> CHCH + H and cis-CHCHF --> CHCH + F are evaluated to be 40+/-2 and 44+/-2 kcal mol(-1), respectively. The photoionization yield spectra indicate that the C2H3 and C2H2F radicals have ionization energies of 8.4+/-0.1 and 8.8+/-0.1 eV, respectively. Universal detection of photoproducts allowed us to determine the total branching ratios, distributions of kinetic energy, average kinetic energies, and fractions of translational energy release for all dissociation pathways of vinyl fluoride. In contrast, on optical excitation at 193 nm the C2H2 + HF channel dominates whereas the C2H3 + F channel is inactive. This reaction C2H3F --> C2H2 + HF occurs on the ground surface of potential energy after excitation at both wavelengths of 193 and 157 nm, indicating that internal conversion from the photoexcited state to the electronic ground state of vinyl fluoride is efficient. We computed the electronic energies of products and the ionization energies of fluorovinyl radicals.",2006,30,11,0,0,0,2,2,1,2,0,1,1,0

At first, the effect of a variable position of the observer window is computed for delta function pulses. A new type of peak suppression effect, the so-called “observer blind spots,” is discussed. Second, a novel procedure for handling pulses of extended length is introduced. It is based on a pulse representation in terms of a sequence of pulse slices and leads to the first analytical expression that correctly describes an ESEEM experiment performed with pulses of any length, provided the EPR linewidth is much larger than the inverse pulse length. The predicted features are verified experimentally, in particular, the formation of blind spots and the influence of the position and the duration of the observer window.",1991,7,10,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,1

Some tumors grow without any apparent restraint whatever. When man harbors a neoplasm of this kind, an increase in the size of the cancer is readily evident from day to day and death ensues in, say, six weeks. Conversely , some malignant growths disappear spontaneously. Both of these an-tipodal effects are rare. Mostly, man with cancer lives 1 year or a little longer after the neoplasm becomes manifest, and it would appear that some inhibition of growth of the tumor takes place to produce this protracted course. The net increment of mass of a cancer is a function of the interaction of the tumor and its soil. Self-control of cancers results from a highly advantageous competition of host with his tumor. There are multiple factors which restrain cancer-enzymatic, nutritional, immunologic, the genotype and others. Prominent among them is the endocrine status, both of tumor and host-the subjects of this discourse. In hormone-responsive cancers, appropriate endocrine modification results in catastrophic effects on cancers of several kinds (Tabl e 1) in man and animals, even in those in the terminal stages of the disease.

The mitogenetic activity of GHRH is exerted through the binding to the pituitary type receptor (pGHRH-R) and its splice variants, mainly SV1. The intracellular signaling pathways that are activated upon the binding of GHRH to the SV1 receptor have not been elucidated. HeLa cervical cancer cells do not express GHRH or GHRH receptors (GHRHRs) and thus do not respond to GHRH or GHRH antagonists. In order to elucidate the mechanism of action of SV1 receptor, we transfected HeLa cells with plasmids for pcDNA3-GHRHR or pcDNA3-SV1. The transfected cells responded to both GHRH (1-29)NH(2) and GHRH antagonist MZ-5-156, as shown by an increase or decrease respectively in the proliferation rate in vitro and the expression of proliferative cell nuclear antigen. We also demonstrated that when the cells transfected with SV1 plasmid are stimulated with GHRH (1-29)NH(2), SV1 receptor activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway (MAPKs), as shown previously for the cells that express pGHRH-R. Our results show, for the first time, the activation of the MAPKs cascade by the SV1 receptor.

Erythrocyte life cycle,"A dog, doubly depleted of blood cells and plasma proteins, was fed dl-lysine labeled with C14 in the epsilon carbon position. In the first 8 hours 28 per cent of the administered C14 was excreted in the urine; in the first 72 hours, 35 per cent. Twenty-four hours after feeding, 4.2 per cent of the fed C14 was circulating in the plasma, decreasing to 1 per cent at the end of 17 days. The C14 content of the blood cells increased from 1 per cent at 24 hours to 5.5 per cent in 5 days and 6.8 per cent in 22 days. Evidence based on the rate of decrease of the C14 content of circulating blood cells is presented indicating an average life of 115 days for the erythrocyte protein as an entity not interchanging with extracellular constituents. This corresponds closely to the life span of the dog erythrocyte, 112 to 133 days according to the best evidence otherwise available and indicates that this experiment has actually measured the life span of the dog erythrocyte.

The gene is split by eight short introns, 48-561 base pairs long, and appears to lack a ""TATA"" box at its promoter. The physical map of the gene was aligned with the genetic map by locating two point mutations and three internal deletions: 0.01 map units correspond to approximately 5 kilobases. Comparison of the unc-54 protein sequence with the sequence of a second myosin heavy chain from nematode, indicates that the globular head sequence S-1 is more highly conserved than the alpha-helical coiled-coil rod.

A quantitative comparison of both structures, however, showed that in the vicinity of some amino acid substitutions considerable changes occur. The comparison also revealed unexpected long range structural changes induced by amino acid deletions. In particular a deletion of four amino acids in the A B corner shifts the whole helix B considerably. 
 
 
 
The general distribution of amino acids in erythrocruorin is analogous to that which has been found in other haemoglobin molecules. The large proportion of phenylalanines in the hydrophobic core of the molecule is remarkable. Also the haem pocket is lined with seven phenylalanine side chains. Four of these are unknown in vertebrate haemoglobins. 
 
 
 
The distal histidine E 7, which is invariant in all known vertebrate haemoglobins, is replaced by a glutamic acid, which has no haem contact, but protrudes into the surrounding solution. This proves that a histidine or another polar residue is not essential for the function of a haemoglobin molecule as a reversible oxygen carrier.",1971,12,129,1,2,9,7,8,7,4,8,6,9,9
8e918b8973e9d040061c0e67125ec087abf59d6c,Subcellular distribution of spinophilin immunolabeling in primate prefrontal cortex: Localization to and within dendritic spines,"Signal transduction in the nervous system depends on kinases and phosphatases, whose localization is regulated by a large group of scaffolding proteins. In particular, protein phosphatase‐1 mediates dopamine's actions on a variety of substrates, including glutamate receptors, and this, in turn, depends on the binding of protein phosphatase‐1 to its binding protein spinophilin. To better understand spinophilin's role in targeting protein phosphatase‐1 within neurons, we used a combination of preembedding immunoperoxidase and postembedding immunogold labeling and electron microscopy to determine the localization of this scaffolding protein in macaque prefrontal cortex. Consistent with previous reports, spinophilin was found predominantly in dendritic spines, but a significant number of labeled dendritic shafts and, less frequently, glia and preterminal axons were also identified. By using the postembedding immunogold method, we further examined the distribution of spinophilin within dendritic spines. Spinophilin immunoreactivity was present throughout the spine, but the density of label was heterogeneous and defined two domains. The highest density of label was associated with the postsynaptic density and the 100 nm immediately subjacent to it. The deeper region of the spine, further than 100 nm from the postsynaptic density, had a lower density of spinophilin label. The distribution of spinophilin reported in this study supports its role in modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission but also suggests the possibility that spinophilin may target protein phosphatase‐1 to other sites within the spine or to other neuronal or glial compartments.

Although the neuronal protein kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) has been implicated in cognitive disorders, its role in learning has been obscured by the perinatal lethality of constitutive knockout mice. Here we report that conditional knockout of Cdk5 in the adult mouse brain improved performance in spatial learning tasks and enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents. Enhanced synaptic plasticity in Cdk5 knockout mice was attributed to reduced NR2B degradation, which caused elevations in total, surface and synaptic NR2B subunit levels and current through NR2B-containing NMDARs. Cdk5 facilitated the degradation of NR2B by directly interacting with both it and its protease, calpain. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which Cdk5 facilitates calpain-mediated proteolysis of NR2B and may control synaptic plasticity and learning.",2007,48,276,18,11,18,20,19,28,20,17,31,19,27

5b77d1b39b7ca1de0a372bf3e47ac940f4ddc54c,A retiring fellow,"A short while ago I received a letter asking me to step down from membership of a board on which I had been serving for quite some time. Normally I refuse to join boards or committees unless a finite, and preferably short, term of service is fixed in advance. But this particular job was not very onerous, I enjoyed doing it, and worst of all, I thought I was doing some good.So when I read the letter, which, I should say, I had been expecting for several years, I was surprised to hear this little complaining voice within me.“They’re getting rid of you”, said junge ego.“True, and about time”, replied alte ego.“But”, shrieked junge ego, “who can possibly fill your place?”.“It doesn’t matter”, replied alte ego, “anybody will do, and you and I can certainly use the time”.“Perhaps you should appeal …”.“No, let's write the letter and go and look for another job”.I have already retired from three jobs and much more gratefully from all the committees and advisory boards that accompany a successful scientific career. Mandatory retirement from boards is a wonderful idea, but for those who wish to remain actively engaged in science, retirement is a source of worry, and increasingly so as that sunset date draws closer.In Japan, where the age of retirement is 60 in some universities, its advent is especially feared, and several of my friends have actually become ill as a result of their retirement. One day you are right at the top, the next day you are thrown on the rubbish heap, and perhaps even forbidden to visit the department. No wonder gastric ulcers are a common disease amongst retired biology professors in Japan. In other countries, you may be offered a small office where you can get your papers in order and write your memoirs, or at least leave something decently organized for your obituarist. I have known departments where so many of the offices were occupied by past distinguished members that there was almost no room for anybody else.Mandatory retirement was made illegal some years ago in America, but I am told that there are numerous loop holes and administrative tricks used to circumvent the rules. They can make continuation dependent on outside research funding, which transfers the decision to a group of individuals who are not sympathetic to either the very old or the very young.One story told to me, which I was assured was absolutely true, concerned the retirement of a professor at one of the more ‘serious’ universities. Apparently, everything had been done to ease his departure. There was a one-day symposium with talks by the more prominent of his past students, and a retirement dinner with speeches and a presentation of a parting gift. At the end of all this, he rose to reply, and calmly informed all gathered there, that he had just discovered he did not have to retire, and that, in fact, he was considering legal action. He assured his audience that he was not leaving and that they should dry their tears, as they would be able to enjoy his company for many years to come.I thought at the time of hearing this story of transforming it into an apocryphal tale, adding an ending in which, on his way home, the man is waylaid in an alley and beaten up by a gang of masked assistant professors, who confirm his retirement by unconventional means. The gang members, of course, have been awaiting the professor's retirement so that they could be candidates for his tenured professorship.Administrators will tell you that mandatory retirement is necessary so that they can promote younger people, and so enable everybody to move up the ladder. But that is the way administrators think and, anyway, the issues involved are really about the control of resources, and not about research. We all know scientists for whom retirement at the age of 35 would not be considered too premature, and conversely there are others, with more decrepit bodies perhaps, who could still outshine the best post-doc you ever saw. I am glad to say that there are 35-year-old scientists who realise that research is not for them and go off and join the biotechnology industry or become editors of scientific journals. And the ancient combatants will always find a way to do research if that is what they want to do. After all, they know all the ropes.In all my retirements, I have so far been able to avoid attending the celebrations of the final symposium and the farewell dinner where I would be presented with some absolutely useless gift to be used in my retirement. I have seen them all — sets of garden tools, golf clubs, elaborate cooling equipment and so on. There is this myth that scientists are longing for the day of their retirement and can’t wait to start indulging in all of the hobbies and activities that they had to set aside while they had their boring jobs of research. This, as every committed scientist knows, is utter rubbish.I hope that the editor will allow me to use this column to let anybody who may be planning a party for me know that I would very much like a multiprocessor work station and an electron microscope as parting gifts. And now, if you will excuse me, I have to go and look for another job.",1997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

6a7f20c187f1e797285300abd0ebd4758adb534e,The FeII-FeIV and FeIII-FeV manifolds in an expanded world of Gif chemistry,"The Gif systems for the selective functionalization of saturated hydrocarbons based on the reactions of Superoxide with FeII and of hydrogen peroxide with FeIII are described. Both systems are relatively efficient, but not nearly so efficient as the electrochemical system developed in collaboration with Prof. G. Balavoine and Dr. Aurore Gref (Université de Paris-Sud-Orsay, France). All of the systems afford mainly ketones. This is an unusual selectivity, which implies a non-radical mechanism. It has been proven for the FeIII-H2O2 system that the activation of the FeIII is independent of the formation of ketone, which involves a hydroperoxide (derived from oxygen) as an intermediate. This intermediate controls the formation of ketone and of secondary alcohol. The addition of a number of trapping reagents such as BrCCl3 diverts the reaction from oxygenation to bromide formation. Although BrCCl3 is indeed a good trap for carbon radicals, the pattern of selectivity across a range of saturated hydrocarbons is completely different for Gif chemistry when compared with normal radical bromination. The chemistry is explained in terms of an FeV oxenoid species that inserts itself into secondary C-H bonds (a compromise between bond strength and steric hindrance). This gives an FeV intermediateA with an iron-carbon bond, which is probably rapidly reduced to the FeIII state by hydrogen peroxide. Then oxygen is inserted into the FeIII-C bond. Hydrolysis affords the isolateable intermediate hydroperoxide (intermediateB). A system based ontert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) is described. This is similar to the above Gif systems, but the kinetic isotope effect is very different and the selectivity for adamantane substitution is different. However, FeIII is activated by TBHP to an FeV oxenoid which, after reaction with a hydrocarbon, reacts with oxygen to give a hydroperoxide. So the pattern of intermediatesA andB is maintained with TBHP. Radical chemistry is involved in some of the reactions that involve ionic coupling to saturated hydrocarbons. The importance of the FeII-FeIV manifold in providing a mechanism that permits the selective functionalization of saturated hydrocarbons by ionic trapping with chloride, azide, and other anions is made manifest. Comparison is made with the FeIII-FeV manifold where ionic trapping is never seen. Traditional Fenton chemistry (hydroxyl radical formation) is not operative here, but the trapping does involve the formation of carbon radicals. These react very efficiently with anions bonded to FeIII.",1995,30,10,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0

In this contribution, we report direct observation of charge separation and recombination in two flavoproteins: riboflavin-binding protein and glucose oxidase. With femtosecond resolution, we observed the ultrafast electron transfer from tryptophan(s) to riboflavin in the riboflavin-binding protein, with two reaction times: ≈100 fs (86% component) and 700 fs (14%). The charge recombination was observed to take place in 8 ps, as probed by the decay of the charge-separated state and the recovery of the ground state. The time scale for charge separation and recombination indicates the local structural tightness for the dynamics to occur that fast and with efficiency of more than 99%. In contrast, in glucose oxidase, electron transfer between flavin-adenine-dinucleotide and tryptophan(s)/tyrosine(s) takes much longer times, 1.8 ps (75%) and 10 ps (25%); the corresponding charge recombination occurs on two time scales, 30 ps and nanoseconds, and the efficiency is still more than 97%. The contrast in time scales for the two structurally different proteins (of the same family) correlates with the distinction in function: hydrophobic recognition of the vitamin in the former requires a tightly bound structure (ultrafast dynamics), and oxidation-reduction reactions in the latter prefer the formation of a charge-separated state that lives long enough for chemistry to occur efficiently. Finally, we also studied the influence on the dynamics of protein conformations at different ionic strengths and denaturant concentrations and observed the sharp collapse of the hydrophobic cleft and, in contrast, the gradual change of glucose oxidase.",2001,70,175,7,1,3,6,2,12,11,11,13,11,5

It was usually impossible to obtain any information about the structure of a source, and adjacent sources could often not be properly separated, whilst attempts to relate the radio sources to optically visible objects were often prevented by the poor positional accuracy. The use of interferometers allowed better posi­ tions to be obtained, and sometimes made it possible to derive simple models for the source structure. Few of the sources were found to have an angular size greater than 2-3’ arc. The problem of making detailed maps of such sources arises simply from the fact that the wavelengths used are some million times greater than optical wavelengths — so that even to obtain a radio picture with the same resolution as that of the unaided human eye (~1’ arc) a tele­ scope having a diameter of about 1 km operating at a wavelength of 50 cm would be needed. At the same time the instrument would be effective only if the surface accuracy was good enough to make a proper image, corresponding to errors of ≤ λ/20 or a few cm; the engineering problems of building such an instrument are clearly enormous. An entirely different approach to the problem is to employ small aerial elements which are moved to occupy successively the whole of a much larger aperture plane. The develop­ ment and use of “aperture synthesis” systems has occupied much of our team in Cambridge over the past 20 years. The principle of the method is ex­ tremely simple. In all methods used to obtain a large resolving power, that is to distinguish the wavefront from a particular direction and ignore those from adjacent directions, we arrange to combine the field measur­ ed over as large an area as possible of the wavefront. In a paraboloid we do this by providing a suitably shaped reflecting surface, so that the fields incident on different parts of the sampled wavefront are combined at the focus (Fig. 1a); the voltage pro­ duced in the receiving dipole repre­ sents the sum of these fields. We can achieve the same result if we use an array of dipoles connected together through equal lengths of cable (Fig. 1b). Suppose now that only a small part of the wavefront is sampled, but that different parts are sampled in turn (Fig. 1c); could we combine these signals to produce the same effect? Since in general, we do not know the phase of the incident field at dif­ ferent times this would not normally be possible but if we continue to measure one of the samples while we measure the others we can use the signal from this one as a phase refer­ ence to correct the values measured in other parts of the wavefront. In this way, by using two small aerial ele­ ments, we can again add the fields over the wavefront — the area of which is now determined by the range of relative positions taken by the two aerial elements. It might be thought that this method would be extremely slow, for if we are Energy and Physics",1975,10,21,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
9769b9c8b22de565036351205be8662ad074963e,Formation of Protocell-like Vesicles in a Thermal Diffusion Column,"Many of the properties of bilayer membranes composed of simple single-chain amphiphiles seem to be well-suited for a potential role as primitive cell membranes. However, the spontaneous formation of membranes from such amphiphiles is a concentration-dependent process in which a significant critical aggregate concentration (cac) must be reached. Since most scenarios for the prebiotic synthesis of fatty acids and related amphiphiles would result in dilute solutions well below the cac, the identification of mechanisms that would lead to increased local amphiphile concentrations is an important aspect of defining reasonable conditions for the origin of cellular life. Narrow, vertically oriented channels within the mineral precipitates of hydrothermal vent towers have previously been proposed to act as natural Clusius−Dickel thermal diffusion columns, in which a strong transverse thermal gradient concentrates dilute molecules through the coupling of thermophoresis and convection. Here we experimentally demonstrate that a microcapillary acting as a thermal diffusion column can concentrate a solution of oleic acid. Upon concentration, self-assembly of large vesicles occurs in regions where the cac is exceeded. We detected vesicle formation by fluorescence microscopy of encapsulated dye cargoes, which simultaneously concentrated in our channels. Our findings suggest a novel means by which simple physical processes could have led to the spontaneous formation of cell-like structures from a dilute prebiotic reservoir.",2009,19,113,1,2,9,8,19,9,11,5,6,10,7

Although this global architecture coincides with the previously reported murine, Syrian hamster, bovine, and human PrPC structures, there are local differences between the globular domains of the different species.

A frontier orbital study of the formation of intermediates in the transition-metal-catalyzed synthesis of diols, amino alcohols, and diamines","The concerted [3 + 21 cycloaddition of an alkene to the oxygen ligands in osmium tetroxide and the binding of the alkene to the metal center leading to an asymmetric intermediate are analyzed from the frontier orbital point of view. It is suggested that the increased reactivity of osmium tetroxide with alkenes in the presence of tertiary amines, e.g., pyridine, follows from a cis addition of pyridine to osmium tetroxide, leading to a geometrical distortion of the osmium tetroxide fragment from Td to an activated Czc symmetry. The calculations are supported by the structure of the products. The reactions of do bis(imido)oxoosmium species with alkenes are examined in a similar way. The reactions of a seemingly very different, yet in fact similar (~5-cyclopentadienyI)dinitrosocobalt complex have also been analyzed from a frontier orbital point of view. The valence MO’s are constructed from the cobalt dinitrosyl cation and cyclopentadienyl anion. The structure of the nitrosyl groups (bent or linear) is studied, and it has been found that the bent structure has the lowest energy. The binding of alkenes to the nitrosyl ligands is examined. The reaction of alkenes with osmium tetroxide to form cis-diols is an old and well-established reaction.’ The reaction takes place via an osmium(V1) intermediate, 1, which on reductive or oxidative hydrolysis yields the corresponding cis-diol.

We characterized three partial revertants that curiously display intermediate UV cytotoxicity (2- to 2.5-fold) but normal levels of UV-induced hprt mutations. In revertant RH1-26, the efficient removal of pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts from both strands of hprt suggests that global-genomic nucleotide excision repair is normal, but the pattern of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer removal suggests that transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is impaired. To explain the intermediate UV survival and lack of RNA synthesis recovery in RH1-26 after 10 J of UV/m2, we propose a defect in repair-transcription coupling, i.e., the inability of the cells to resume or reinitiate transcription after the first TCR event within a transcript. All three revertants carry an R658H suppressor mutation, in one allele of revertants RH1-26 and RH1-53 and in both alleles of revertant RH1-3. Remarkably, the R658H mutation produces the clinical phenotype of trichothiodystrophy (TTD) in several patients who display intermediate UV sensitivity. The XPDR658HTTD protein, like XPDT46I/R658H, is codominant when overexpressed in V-H1 cells and partially complements their UV sensitivity. Thus, the suppressing R658H substitution must restore helicase activity to the inactive XPDT46Iprotein. Based on current knowledge of helicase structure, the intragenic reversion mutation may partially compensate for the T46I mutation by perturbing the XPD structure in a way that counteracts the effect of this mutation. These findings have implications for understanding the differences between xeroderma pigmentosum and TTD and illustrate the value of suppressor genetics for studying helicase structure-function relationships.",2001,76,8,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0

The SF/sub 6/ molecules serve both as the /sup 19/F target for the /sup 19/F(n,2n)/sup 18/F fast neutron reaction and as the moderator for removing the excess kinetic energy imparted to the /sup 18/F atoms by nuclear recoil. Moderator/substrate ratios > 100 are large enough that hot atom reactions have been suppressed to yields well below 1%, with almost all /sup 18/F atoms reacting as thermal atoms. Three thermal reactions are dominant with propene, with yields of about 32% for terminal addition to form CH/sub 3/CHCH/sub 2//sup 18/F*; 23% for central addition to form CH/sub 3/CH/sup 18/FCH/sub 2/*; and 45% for abstraction of H to form H/sup 18/F. Terminal addition is favored over central addition for thermal /sup 18/F atoms by a factor of 1.35 +/- 0.05.

d3b5602e350baa26918d63c4a9b82ce824bddd21,"The pKa values of two histidine residues in human haemoglobin, the Bohr effect, and the dipole moments of alpha-helices.","Studies of abnormal and chemically modified haemoglobins indicate that in 0.1 M-NaCl about 40% of the alkaline Bohr effect of human haemoglobin is contributed by the C-terminal histidine HC3(146) beta. In deoxyhaemoglobin, the imidazole of this histidine forms a salt bridge with aspartate FG1(94) beta, in oxyhaemoglobin or carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin it accepts a hydrogen bond from its own NH group instead. Kilmartin et al. (1973) showed that in 0.2 M-NaCl + 0.2 M-phosphate this change of ligation lowered the pKa of the histidine from 8.0 in Hb to 7.1 in HbCO, but Russu et al. (1980) claimed that in bis-Tris buffer without added NaCl its pKa in HbCO dropped no lower than 7.85, and that in this medium the C-terminal histidine made only a negligible contribution to the alkaline Bohr effect. We have compared the histidine resonances of HbCO A with those of three abnormal haemoglobins: HbCO Cowtown (His HC3(146)beta----Leu), HbCO Wood (His FG4(97)beta----Leu) and HbCO Malmø (His FG4(97)beta----Gln). Our results show that the resonance assigned by Russu et al. to His HC3(146)beta in fact belongs to His FG4(97)beta. Although in Hb the pKa of His HC3(146)beta is 8.05 +/- 0.05 independent of ionic strength, in HbCO its pKa drops sharply with diminishing ionic strength, so that in the buffer employed by Russu et al. it has a pKa of 6.2 and makes a contribution to the alkaline Bohr effect that is 57% larger than in the phosphate buffer employed by Kilmartin et al. (1973). In HbCO A, His FG4(97)beta does not contribute to the Bohr effect, but in HbCO from which His HC3(146)beta has been cleaved (HbCO des-His), His FG4(97)beta is in equilibrium between two conformations with different pKa values. This equilibrium varies with ionic strength and pH, and presumably also with degree of ligation of the haem moiety. In HbCO A, His FG4(97)beta has a pKa of 7.8 compared to the pKa value of about 6.6 characteristic of free histidines at the surface of proteins. This high pKa is accounted for by its interaction with the negative pole at the C terminus of helices F and FG. It corresponds to a free energy change of the same order as that observed in the interaction of histidines with carboxylate ions and confirms the strongly dipolar character of alpha-helices, which manifests itself even when they lie on the surface of the protein.",1985,32,86,1,1,7,6,5,4,4,7,1,2,4

Effectiveness of moricizine (Ethmozine) in patients resistant to conventional antiarrhythmics.,"On the basis of epidemiologic studies, more than 10 million Americans have echocardiographic evidence of mitral valve prolapse. Although ventricular arrhythmias occur frequently (over 50 percent of patients with mitral valve prolapse), they rarely result in sustained ventricular tachycardia or sudden cardiac death. However, a common problem in clinical practice is a patient with mitral valve prolapse and symptomatic complex ventricular arrhythmias refractory or intolerant to both beta blockers and conventional type I antiarrhythmics. These drugs are known to have frequent side effects, toxicity, and proarrhythmic effects. In 17 patients with mitral valve prolapse who presented with symptomatic complex ventricular arrhythmias and who were unresponsive to an average of the three conventional agents, moricizine (Ethmozine) was effective in suppressing 90 percent of ventricular premature depolarizations, 99 percent of nonsustained runs of ventricular tachycardia, as well as all sustained runs of ventricular tachycardia, resulting in abolition of palpitations, dizziness, and syncopal episodes. Its efficacy as well as its low frequency of minor side effects makes it ideal for future consideration in the population with mitral valve prolapse, who are frequently young and may therefore require therapy for many years.",1986,39,15,0,0,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1

Beam filamentation due to self-focusing in the gain medium is found to limit fundamental-mode output to narrow stripe lasers or to operation close to lasing threshold. Differences between nitride and conventional near-infrared semiconductor lasers arise because of band structure differences, in particular, the presence of a strong quantum-confined Stark effect in the former. Increasing mirror reflectivities in plane-plane resonators to reduce lasing threshold current tends to exacerbate the filamentation problem. On the other hand, a negative-branch unstable resonator is found to mitigate filament effects, enabling fundamental-mode operation far above threshold in broad-area lasers.",2001,19,25,0,0,0,3,0,1,4,1,4,4,1

017cba060b4357f41b3d48d0d7dacae168016f31,The ubiquitin system: historical perspective.,"The discovery of covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin emerged from a search after an enzyme that will carry out regulated proteolysis of cellular proteins. This was in the mid1970s, when scientists focused mostly on translation of the genetic code into proteins: how proteins are removed had remained a neglected area, regarded as a nonspecific, unimportant end process. The handful of scientists that were interested in the problem hypothesized that the mechanism must be nonlysosomal, as lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins could not explain certain observations related to the specificity of the process. It was also clear that any cellular protease(s) must be under control to prevent nonspecific destruction. Now, three decades later, we realize that the beginning was indeed humble. Along with other major regulatory mechanisms such as transcription and phosphorylation, degradation of intracellular proteins by the ubiquitin system plays important roles in a broad array of cellular processes, such as cell cycle, apoptosis, processing of signals from the extracellular environment, maintenance of the genome and proteome integrity, and providing the cell with the ability to withstand stress. Not surprisingly, aberrations in the system have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, and malignancies among them. Consequently, mechanism-based drugs have been developed. Importantly, modification by ubiquitin has been shown to serve nonproteolytic functions, such as regulation of transcription and signaling, that along with the discovery of a family of ubiquitin-like modifiers (among them SUMO [Small Ubiquitin MOdifier] and NEDD8 [Neural precursor cell-Expressed Developmentally Downregulated]) that serve both nonproteolytic and proteolytic functions, have broadened the scope of this novel form of posttranslational modification to affect almost all basic cellular processes. In many ways ubiquitination is similar to phosphorylation: it is a reversible covalent modification that is rapid, specific, and diverse. It is performed by approximately 750 conjugating enzymes that act in a cascade mechanism (2 E1s, z50 E2s, and z700 E3s), which can be compared with the z500 kinases, the activity of which can be reversed by z90 deubiquitinating enzymes [DUBs], which are similar to the z120 phosphatases. Yet, it appears that the ‘‘language’’ of ubiquitination is richer than that of phosphorylation, because the modifying molecule is a protein. Ubiquitin can modify a protein once, but also can generate polymerized chains. The chains can be of varying lengths and of varying types, dependent on the internal linkages between its links. It appears that the two modes of post-translational modification act together to orchestrate many processes such as cell cycle and division, processing of signals, apoptosis, endocytosis, phagocystosis, and DNA repair via both proteolytic and nonproteolytic mechanisms. It is interesting to note that until the late 1930s, body proteins were thought to be essentially stable, and dietary proteins were believed to function primarily as a source of energy. This concept was challenged by Rudolf Schoenheimer, who worked at Columbia University in New York City. Schoenheimer, a Jewish biochemist who escaped racist Germany, administered 15N-labeled tyrosine to rat and found that a large part of it ‘‘is deposited in tissue proteins’’; later, ‘‘an equivalent of protein nitrogen is excreted.’’ This and additional experiments led him to conclude (in a small book, The Dynamic State of Body Constituents, that was published in 1942 after his death [1]) that ‘‘[t]he simile of the combustion engine pictured the steady-state flow of fuel into a fixed system, and the conversion of this fuel into waste products. The new results imply that not only the fuel, but the structural materials are in a steady state of flux. The classical picture must thus be replaced by one which takes account of the dynamic state of body structure.’’ What was missing was obviously the mechanism that carries out this novel task. The discovery of the lysosome by Christian de Duve in the early 1950s (2) was a turning point in studies on protein degradation. The finding that the proteases were separated from their substrates by a membrane provided an explanation for controlled degradation, and the only problem left to be explained was how the substrates are translocated into the lysosomal lumen where they are degraded by the lysosomal proteases. An important discovery in this respect was the unraveling of the mechanism of action of the lysosome under basal conditions: microautophagy; during this process small portions of the cytoplasm (which contain the entire cohort of cellular proteins) are captured in vesicles and tubules that are formed by intraluminal invagination of the endosomal or lysosomal membrane. The contents of these vesicles are digested as the vesicles are consumed by the lysosome. The second discovery was that intracellular proteolysis in both mammalian (3) and bacterial (4) cells requires metabolic energy. Since proteolysis is thermodynamically exergonic, the energy requirement suggested that the underlying mechanisms must be complex, and that the energy is required to allow control and endow the system(s) involved with specificity toward their substrates. In an attempt to defend the ‘‘lysosomal hypothesis,’’ it was suggested that energy was required to maintain the low intralysosomal pH in which the lysosomal proteases act optimally. This is a safety mechanism that ensures that if leakage occurs, the proteases will be inactivated by the high cytosolic pH. While it is clear that energy is required for the maintenance of the intralysosomal acidic environment, this mechanism could not have been the only explanation for energy consumption for intracellular proteolysis, since bacteria do not have lysosomes: a more fundamental mechanism was still absent. In addition, it has gradually become difficult to explain several aspects of intracellular protein degradation based on the known mechanisms (Received in original form August 31, 2009; accepted in final form September 2, 2009)",2010,13,6,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,0

cf969f8ef890b89d659ef536343a1c59bffa4356,Structure of the mitochondrial ATP synthase from Pichia angusta determined by electron cryo-microscopy,"Significance Living cells need fuel in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, to stay alive. This fuel is generated by a molecular machine made of two motors joined by a rotor. One generates rotation by using energy provided by oxidative metabolism or photosynthesis; the other uses energy transmitted by the rotor to make ATP molecules from its building blocks, adenosine diphosphate, or ADP, and inorganic phosphate. The structure has been determined of a fungal machine, isolated from its cellular power stations, the mitochondria, where the machine operates. It provides unsuspected details of the blueprint of the machine and how it works. The working principles of the fungal machine apply to similar machines in all species. The structure of the intact monomeric ATP synthase from the fungus, Pichia angusta, has been solved by electron cryo-microscopy. The structure provides insights into the mechanical coupling of the transmembrane proton motive force across mitochondrial membranes in the synthesis of ATP. This mechanism requires a strong and integral stator, consisting of the catalytic α3β3-domain, peripheral stalk, and, in the membrane domain, subunit a and associated supernumerary subunits, kept in contact with the rotor turning at speeds up to 350 Hz. The stator’s integrity is ensured by robust attachment of both the oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein (OSCP) to the catalytic domain and the membrane domain of subunit b to subunit a. The ATP8 subunit provides an additional brace between the peripheral stalk and subunit a. At the junction between the OSCP and the apparently stiff, elongated α-helical b-subunit and associated d- and h-subunits, an elbow or joint allows the stator to bend to accommodate lateral movements during the activity of the catalytic domain. The stator may also apply lateral force to help keep the static a-subunit and rotating c10-ring together. The interface between the c10-ring and the a-subunit contains the transmembrane pathway for protons, and their passage across the membrane generates the turning of the rotor. The pathway has two half-channels containing conserved polar residues provided by a bundle of four α-helices inclined at ∼30° to the plane of the membrane, similar to those described in other species. The structure provides more insights into the workings of this amazing machine.",2016,45,49,2,0,11,18,11,7,2,0,0,0,0

The activation of this enzyme by serotonin was selectively inhibited by extremely low concentrations of D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 2-bromo-LSD, and cyproheptadine, agents which are known to block certain serotonin receptors in vivo. The inhibition was competitive with respect to serotonin, and the calculated inhibitory constant of LSD for this serotonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase was 5 nM. The data are consistent with a model in which the serotonin receptor of neural tissue is intimately associated with a serotonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase which mediates serotonergic neurotransmission. The results are also compatible with the possibility that some of the physiological effects of LSD may be mediated through interaction with serotonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase.",1974,0,90,1,0,4,5,7,10,6,3,7,5,2

Here, the binding sites have been defined. Subcloned fragments of XRCC1 have been expressed and assayed for their ability to associate with DNA ligase III by far Western and affinity precipitation analyses. The C-terminal 96 amino acids of XRCC1 are necessary and sufficient for the specific interaction with DNA ligase III. A similar approach with the 103 kDa DNA ligase III has identified the C-terminal 148 amino acids of this enzyme as containing the binding site for XRCC1. An alternative 96 kDa form of DNA ligase III, abundant in testes, has been described [Chen, J., et al. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 5412-5422]. These two forms of DNA ligase III have identical N-terminal regions but differ toward their C termini and may be alternatively spliced products of the same gene. Antipeptide antibodies directed against the different C termini of the two forms of the enzyme indicate that both of them occur in vivo. The C-terminal region of the 96 kDa derivative of DNA ligase III is not able to interact with XRCC1. These findings indicate that only the larger form of DNA ligase III acts together with XRCC1, suggesting a role for this isoform of the enzyme in base excision repair.",1997,0,276,9,7,17,17,21,22,12,18,14,16,13

In an effort to understand substrate determinants of this repair system, we tested DNAs with minor backbone modifications using the ultrasensitive excision assay. We found that a phosphorothioate and a methylphosphonate were excised with low efficiency. Surprisingly, we also found that fragments of 23–28 nucleotides and of 12–13 nucleotides characteristic of human and Escherichia coliexcision repair, respectively, were removed from undamaged DNA at a significant rate. Considering the relative abundance of undamaged DNA in comparison to damaged DNA in the course of the life of an organism, we conclude that, in general, excision from and resynthesis of undamaged DNA may exceed the excision and resynthesis caused by DNA damage.

17658bf315fdbd86e9c9f7125c60a1435c4b74b8,Photon gating in four-dimensional ultrafast electron microscopy,"Significance In this contribution, we demonstrate a unique concept in the use of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy—combining one electron pulse and two optical pulses—as a probe for ultrafast dynamics of matter in electron microscopy. Photon–electron coupling permits the use of a short optical pulse to gate the electron pulse, which is serving as a probe of the ultrafast dynamics triggered by another optical pulse. This technique provides the high spatial and temporal resolution of the electron pulse and optical laser pulses, respectively, both in ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) measurements. This development paves the way for numerous studies in imaging of matter not only with few femtosecond resolution but also with the potential for attosecond imaging in UEM. Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) is a pivotal tool for imaging of nanoscale structural dynamics with subparticle resolution on the time scale of atomic motion. Photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), a key UEM technique, involves the detection of electrons that have gained energy from a femtosecond optical pulse via photon–electron coupling on nanostructures. PINEM has been applied in various fields of study, from materials science to biological imaging, exploiting the unique spatial, energy, and temporal characteristics of the PINEM electrons gained by interaction with a “single” light pulse. The further potential of photon-gated PINEM electrons in probing ultrafast dynamics of matter and the optical gating of electrons by invoking a “second” optical pulse has previously been proposed and examined theoretically in our group. Here, we experimentally demonstrate this photon-gating technique, and, through diffraction, visualize the phase transition dynamics in vanadium dioxide nanoparticles. With optical gating of PINEM electrons, imaging temporal resolution was improved by a factor of 3 or better, being limited only by the optical pulse widths. This work enables the combination of the high spatial resolution of electron microscopy and the ultrafast temporal response of the optical pulses, which provides a promising approach to attain the resolution of few femtoseconds and attoseconds in UEM.",2015,49,26,1,1,7,6,6,1,4,1,0,0,0

We examined the role of the p53-induced microRNA miR-34a in hematopoiesis by gain-of-function analysis in murine bone marrow. Constitutive expression of miR-34a led to a block in B cell development at the pro-B-cell-to-pre-B-cell transition, leading to a reduction in mature B cells. This block appeared to be mediated primarily by inhibited expression of the transcription factor Foxp1. Foxp1 was a direct target of miR-34a in a 3'-untranslated region (UTR)-dependent fashion. Knockdown of Foxp1 by siRNA recapitulated the B cell developmental phenotype induced by miR-34a, whereas cotransduction of Foxp1 lacking its 3' UTR with miR-34a rescued B cell maturation. Knockdown of miR-34a resulted in increased amounts of Foxp1 and mature B cells. These findings identify a role for miR-34a in connecting the p53 network with suppression of Foxp1, a known B cell oncogene.",2010,43,213,15,1,11,21,24,35,25,22,17,17,12

Although important roles for the fetus and placenta in triggering labor have been proposed, no gene has been shown to be required in the fetus/placenta for labor induction. Here we show that Nrk, an X-linked gene encoding a Ser/Thr kinase of the germinal center kinase family, is essential in the fetus/placenta for labor in mice. Nrk was specifically expressed in the spongiotrophoblast layer, a fetus-derived region of the placenta, and Nrk disruption caused dysregulated overgrowth of the layer. Due to preferential inactivation of the paternally derived X chromosome in placenta, Nrk heterozygous mutant placentas exhibited a similar defect to that in Nrk-null tissues when the wild-type allele was paternally derived. However, the phenotype was weaker than in Nrk-null placentas due to leaky Nrk expression from the inactivated X chromosome. Crossing of Nrk-null females to wild-type and Nrk-null males, as well as uterine transfer of Nrk-null fetuses to wild-type females, revealed that pregnant mice exhibit a severe defect in delivery when all fetuses/placentas are Nrk-null. In addition, Nrk was not expressed in female reproductive tissues such as the uterus and ovary, as well as the fetal amnion and yolk sac, in pregnant mice. Progesterone and estrogen levels in the maternal circulation and placenta, which control the timing of labor, were unaffected upon Nrk disruption. We thus provide evidence for a novel labor-inducing fetoplacental signal that depends on the X chromosome and possibly arises from the placenta.",2011,41,19,2,0,1,2,1,1,2,2,0,2,4

6777a6394cf3fb6012ba89d92f74c011da28ad10,Role of frontier orbitals in chemical reactions.,"Since the 3rd century for more than a thousand years chemistry has been thought of as a complicated, hard-to-predict science. Efforts to improve even a part of its unpredictable character are said to have born fruit first of all in the success of the "" electronic theory "". This was founded mainly by organic chemists , such as Fry, Stieglitz, Lucas, Lapworth and Sidgwick, brought to a completed form by Robinson and Ingold, and developed later by many other chemists. 1 In the electronic theory, the mode of migration of electrons in molecules is noted and is considered under various judgements. For that purpose, a criterion is necessary with respect to the number of electrons which should originally exist in an atom or a bond in a molecule. Therefore, it can be said to be the concept by Lewis of the sharing of electrons that has given a firm basis to the electronic theory. 2 In the organic electronic theory, the chemical concepts such as acid and base, oxidation and reduction and so on, have been conveniently utilized from a long time ago. Furthermore, there are terms centring closer around the electron concept, such as electrophilicity and nucleophilicity, and electron donor and acceptor both being pairs of relative concepts. One may be aware that these concepts can be connected qualitatively to the scale of electron density or electric charge. In the electronic theory, the static and dynamic behaviours of molecules are explained by the electronic effects which are based on nothing but the distribution of electrons in a molecule. The mode of charge distribution in a molecule can be sketched to some extent by the use of the electronegativity concept of atoms through organic chemical experience. At the same time, it is given foundation, made quantitative , and supported by physical measurements of electron distribution and theoretical calculations based on quantum theory. The distribution of electrons or electric charge-with either use the result is unchanged-in a molecule is usually represented by the total numbers (generally not integer) of electrons in each atom and each bond, and it was a concept easily acceptable even to empirical chemists as having a tolerably realistic meaning. Therefore, chemists employed the electron density as a fundamental concept to explain or to comprehend various phenomena. In particular, for the purpose of promoting chemical investigations, researchers usually rely upon the analogy through experience, and the electron density …",1982,137,1541,9,0,1,2,3,2,1,2,1,5,10

Only the loss of the acetylenic hydrogen atom was observed; the methyl group is conserved in the reaction. Electronic structure calculations reveal that the reaction has an entrance barrier of about 17 kJ mol−1.

Absorption experiments in Muir Lake (alt. 11,800 feet).—The sinking of sealed electroscope No. 3 in Muir Lake showed an ionization decreasing steadily with depth from 13.3 ions per cc per sec. at the surface to 3.6 ions at 50 feet below the surface, below which there was no further decrease. The absorption curve of electroscope No. 3 was in excellent agreement with that of No. 1. 
2. Absorption experiments in Arrowhead Lake (alt. 5,100 feet).—The electroscope readings in Arrowhead Lake correspond uniformly to readings six feet deeper in Muir Lake. This difference is the exact water equivalent of the absorption of the atmosphere between the two elevations. All readings of both electroscopes fit satisfactorily upon a single curve relating ionization to depth beneath the surface of the atmosphere in equivalent meters of water. 
3. Rays of cosmic origin.—1 and 2 combined with the failure to detect any systematic diurnal variation, in tests of a number of days duration at high altitudes, constitute new and quite unambiguous evidence for the existence of very hard etherial rays of cosmic origin entering the earth uniformly from all directions. 
4. Spectral distribution of cosmic rays.—No single absorption coefficient is found to fit the absorption curve, the lower end of which requires a coefficient of.18 per meter of water; the upper end a coefficient,.30 per meter of water. These coefficients correspond, by Compton's equations, to wave-lengths λ=.00038A and λ=.00063A. These are fifty times the frequencies of ordinary gamma rays, λ=.025A, and the former corresponds to an energy of 32,000,000 volts. 
5. Number of pairs of ions due to cosmic rays.—The observed number of pairs of ions in electroscope No. 1 due to cosmic rays is about 1.4 at sea level, 2.6 at 1600 meters, 4.8 at 3600 meters, 5.9 at 4300 meters. 
6. Stimulated secondary rays.—Theoretically, cosmic rays of the foregoing energy should not stimulate ether waves of gamma ray hardness, but should produce beta rays capable of penetrating brass walls 5 mm thick. The observations present evidence of rays of about this hardness increasing systematically with altitude in rough proportionality to the intensity of the cosmic rays. This evidence is not completely convincing because of inability thus far to eliminate the effects of the gamma rays from the underlying rocks. 
7. Origin of cosmic rays.—Evidence is presented that these rays do not result from the union of protons with negative electrons, but they are rather due to nuclear changes of about one-thirtieth the energy corresponding to such union, taking place throughout the depths of the universe.",1926,0,47,1,0,2,1,0,2,1,1,0,0,0

Seven spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and six normotensive Wistar Kyoto control rats (WKY) were tested repeatedly on eight behaviour parameters in this apparatus. A two-compartment free-exploration open field evokes less fear than the standard one-compartment forced-exploration open field, because it permits the rat to enter the field from its home cage. The data were subjected to principal component analysis and multivariate analysis of variance. The results showed that the recorded behaviour grouped into two independent components, encompassing behaviour in the cage and in the field, respectively. These components are interpreted as reflecting different kinds of exploration: (i) distant exploration when the rat explores from its home cage, and (ii) close exploration when the rat explores by entering the novel field. The SHR scored highest on both, although they mostly used close exploration. In the WKY rats, which mainly stayed in their cages, distant exploration was predominant. The present free-exploration open-field procedure discriminates between two different exploration strategies employed by SHR and WKY rats.",1988,13,32,1,0,0,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,0

We have analysed the steady-state levels and repair kinetics of oxidative DNA modifications in cells of homozygous ogg1(-/-) null mice, which are deficient in Ogg1 protein, a DNA repair glycosylase that removes the miscoding base 8-hydroxyguanine (8-oxoG) from the genome. Oxidative purine modifications including 8-oxoG were quantified by means of an alkaline elution assay in combination with Fpg protein, the bacterial functional analogue of Ogg1 protein. In primary hepatocytes of adult ogg1(-/-) mice aged 9-12 months, the steady-state level of the lesions was 2.8-fold higher than in wild-type control mice. In contrast, no difference between ogg1(-/-) and wild-type mice was observed in splenocytes, spermatocytes and kidney cells. In hepatocytes of ogg1(-/-) mice, but not in wild-type controls, the steady-state levels increased continuously over the whole lifespan. No significant accumulation of the oxidative base modifications was observed in ogg1(-/-) fibroblasts in culture when they were kept confluent for 8 days. Both in confluent and proliferating ogg1(-/-) fibroblasts, the global repair of additional oxidative base modifications induced by photosensitization was 4-fold slower than in wild-type cells. The results suggest that the consequences of an Ogg1 defect are restricted to slowly proliferating tissues with high oxygen metabolism such as liver, because of a back-up mechanism for the repair of 8-oxoG residues that is independent of transcription and replication.",2001,36,176,3,1,11,12,13,15,16,20,10,10,6

O. Martins, R. Huber, H. Huber, K. O. Stetter, M. S. da Costa, and H. Santos, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63:896–902, 1997). This solute was purified after extraction from the cell biomass. In addition, the optically active and the optically inactive (racemic) forms of the compound were synthesized, and the ability of the solute to act as a protecting agent against heating was tested on several proteins derived from mesophilic or hyperthermophilic sources. Diglycerol phosphate exerted a considerable stabilizing effect against heat inactivation of rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase, baker's yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, andThermococcus litoralis glutamate dehydrogenase. Highly homologous and structurally well-characterized rubredoxins fromDesulfovibrio gigas, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (ATCC 27774), and Clostridium pasteurianum were also examined for their thermal stabilities in the presence or absence of diglycerol phosphate, glycerol, and inorganic phosphate. These proteins showed different intrinsic thermostabilities, with half-lives in the range of 30 to 100 min. Diglycerol phosphate exerted a strong protecting effect, with approximately a fourfold increase in the half-lives for the loss of the visible spectra of D. gigas and C. pasteurianumrubredoxins. In contrast, the stability of D. desulfuricansrubredoxin was not affected. These different behaviors are discussed in the light of the known structural features of rubredoxins.

a92aa5206df0ebcf5ec4730af41f55076156f235,Loss of perivascular aquaporin 4 may underlie deficient water and K+ homeostasis in the human epileptogenic hippocampus.,"An abnormal accumulation of extracellular K+ in the brain has been implicated in the generation of seizures in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and hippocampal sclerosis. Experimental studies have shown that clearance of extracellular K+ is compromised by removal of the perivascular pool of the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4), suggesting that an efficient clearance of K+ depends on a concomitant water flux through astrocyte membranes. Therefore, we hypothesized that loss of perivascular AQP4 might be involved in the pathogenesis of MTLE. Whereas Western blot analysis showed an overall increase in AQP4 levels in MTLE compared with non-MTLE hippocampi, quantitative ImmunoGold electron microscopy revealed that the density of AQP4 along the perivascular membrane domain of astrocytes was reduced by 44% in area CA1 of MTLE vs. non-MTLE hippocampi. There was no difference in the density of AQP4 on the astrocyte membrane facing the neuropil. Because anchoring of AQP4 to the perivascular astrocyte endfoot membrane depends on the dystrophin complex, the localization of the 71-kDa brain-specific isoform of dystrophin was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In non-MTLE hippocampus, dystrophin was preferentially localized near blood vessels. However, in the MTLE hippocampus, the perivascular dystrophin was absent in sclerotic areas, suggesting that the loss of perivascular AQP4 is secondary to a disruption of the dystrophin complex. We postulate that the loss of perivascular AQP4 in MTLE is likely to result in a perturbed flux of water through astrocytes leading to an impaired buffering of extracellular K+ and an increased propensity for seizures.",2005,56,240,9,6,15,16,9,18,9,18,20,21,11

In PC-3 tumor membranes a radiolabeled GHRH antagonist [125I]-JV-1-42 was bound to one class of high-affinity binding sites (K(d)=1.81+/-0.47 nM) and maximum binding capacity of 332.7+/-27.8 fmol/mg membrane protein. The in vivo uptake of [125I]-JV-1-42 was observed in all xenografts of human prostate cancer, the tracer accumulation being the highest in PC-3 tumors. These results indicate that GHRH and SVs of its receptors, different from those found in the pituitary, are present in experimental human prostate cancers and may form a local mitogenic loop. The antiproliferative effects of GHRH antagonists on growth of prostate cancer could be exerted in part by an interference with this local GHRH system.",2002,32,46,0,4,6,3,9,4,3,5,2,3,3

The dependence of interaction energy and structure on the size of the cluster was investigated with a large basis set including polarization functions. The effects of electron correlation were considered by Moller-Plesset perturbation theory. A surprisingly large increase in the interaction energy from 5 kcal/mol to 23 kcal/mol occurs when the cluster size reaches three atoms with a decrease in the Be-O distance from 1.71 to 1.64 A. The dissociation energy shows no further large changes when the cluster size is increased to four and five atoms. The H2O is found to prefer corner binding sites significantly over edge or face sites on the clusters. The nature of the bonding between H2O and the Be clusters is discussed.",2009,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Induction of a specific antigen by EBV from two transformed marmoset cell lines in ramos cells,"Infection of cells of the EBV‐genome‐negative human B‐lymphoma Ramos line with viral isolates obtained from two EBV‐transformed marmoset cell lines (B95/8; Nyevu) resulted in the induction of a nuclear antigen (RAM‐ag) apparently different from other EBV‐associated antigen complexes. This antigen is revealed by indirect immunofluorescence and shows no detectable cross‐antigenicity with EBNA or any other known EBV‐associated antigen. EBV‐isolates from P3HR‐1 cells fail to induce a similar antigen in Ramos cells although they induce EBNA. No RAM‐ag was expressed, either after infection of cells of another EBV‐genome‐negative human B‐lymphoma line BJAB with B95‐8 EBV or in a series of EBV‐harbouring cell lines. Thus the antigen appears to be cell‐line‐specific for Ramos cells. It is also induced upon infection of either B95‐8 or P3HR‐1 converted Ramos sublines with EBV from B95‐8 cells. All human sera with RAM‐ag‐reactivity revealed antibodies against VCA. However, sera from patients with acute infectious mononucleosis containing high anti‐VCA‐antibodies did not react with RAM‐ag. Seroconversion for this antigen apparently more closely coincides with the appearance of EBNA‐directed antibodies.",1978,23,10,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
a1a08d346bee4fa4ede51f1d9b3149c2befab28e,Integration-Free iPS Cells Engineered Using Human Artificial Chromosome Vectors,"Human artificial chromosomes (HACs) have unique characteristics as gene-delivery vectors, including episomal transmission and transfer of multiple, large transgenes. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of HAC vectors for reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Two HAC vectors (iHAC1 and iHAC2) were constructed. Both carried four reprogramming factors, and iHAC2 also encoded a p53-knockdown cassette. iHAC1 partially reprogrammed MEFs, and iHAC2 efficiently reprogrammed MEFs. Global gene expression patterns showed that the iHACs, unlike other vectors, generated relatively uniform iPS cells. Under non-selecting conditions, we established iHAC-free iPS cells by isolating cells that spontaneously lost iHAC2. Analyses of pluripotent markers, teratomas and chimeras confirmed that these iHAC-free iPS cells were pluripotent. Moreover, iHAC-free iPS cells with a re-introduced HAC encoding Herpes Simplex virus thymidine kinase were eliminated by ganciclovir treatment, indicating that the HAC safeguard system functioned in iPS cells. Thus, the HAC vector could generate uniform, integration-free iPS cells with a built-in safeguard system.",2011,43,64,0,1,4,13,9,14,7,6,2,2,6
42f17aee732a6ebea59f40860d1a0932a967c224,Asymptotically free gauge theories. I,"Asymptotically free gauge theories of the strong interactions are constructed and analyzed. The reasons for doing this are recounted, including a review of renormalization-group techniques and their application to scaling phenomena. The renormalization-group equations are derived for Yang-Mills theories. The parameters that enter into the equations are calculated to lowest order and it is shown that these theories are asymptotically free. More specifically the effective coupling constant, which determines the ultraviolet behavior of the theory, vanishes for large spacelike momenta. Fermions are incorporated and the construction of realistic models is discussed. We propose that the strong interactions be mediated by a ""color"" gauge group which commutes with SU(3) × SU(3). The problem of symmetry breaking is discussed. It appears likely that this would have a dynamical origin. It is suggested that the gauge symmetry might not be broken and that the severe infrared singularities prevent the occurrence of noncolor singlet physical states. The deep-inelastic structure functions, as well as the electron-positron total annihilation cross section are analyzed. Scaling obtains up to calculable logarithmic corrections, and the naive light-cone or parton-model results follow. The problems of incorporating scalar mesons and breaking the symmetry by the Higgs mechanism are explained in detail.",1973,3,1038,35,0,8,6,8,5,7,21,12,11,9
abde1a4a4eeca74d503d947c60cae851df54ffdb,The 2.3 A crystal structure of the catalytic domain of recombinant two-chain human tissue-type plasminogen activator.,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), a multidomainal serine proteinase of the trypsin-family, catalyses the rate-limiting step in fibrinolysis, the activation of plasminogen to the fibrin-degrading proteinase plasmin. Trigonal crystals have been obtained of the recombinant catalytic domain of human-two-chain t-PA, consisting of a 17 residue A chain and the 252 residue B chain. Its X-ray crystal structure has been solved applying Patterson and isomorphous replacement methods, and has been crystallographically refined to an R-value of 0.184 at 2.3 A resolution. The chain fold, active-site geometry and Ile276-Asp477 salt bridge are similar to that observed for trypsin. A few surface-located insertion loops differ significantly, however. The disulfide bridge Cys315-Cys384, practically unique to the plasminogen activators, is incorporated without drastic conformational changes as the insertion loop preceding Cys384 makes a bulge on the molecular surface. The unique basic insertion loop Lys296-Arg304 flanking the primed subsites, which has been shown to be of importance for PAI-1 binding and for fibrin specificity, is partially disordered; it can therefore freely adapt to proteins docking to the active site. The S1 pocket of t-PA is almost identical to that of trypsin, whereas the S2 site is considerably reduced in size by the imposing Tyr368 side-chain, in agreement with the measured preference for P1 Arg and P2 Gly residues. The neighbouring S3-S4 hydrophobic groove is mainly hydrophobic in nature. The structure of the proteinase domain of two-chain t-PA suggests that the formation of a salt bridge between Lys429 and Asp477 may contribute to the unusually high catalytic activity of single-chain t-PA, thus stabilizing the catalytically active conformation without unmasking the Ile276 amino terminus. Modeling studies show that the covalently bound kringle 2 domain in full-length t-PA could interact with an extended hydrophobic groove in the catalytic domain; in such a docking geometry its ""lysine binding site"" and the ""fibrin binding patch"" of the catalytic domain are in close proximity.",1996,0,124,4,2,14,11,12,12,9,5,5,7,6
2b172761f4f57eb80667f7b58d7a2678ee4b6223,Deletion of Mint Proteins Decreases Amyloid Production in Transgenic Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease,"Mints/X11s are neuronal adaptor proteins that bind to amyloid-β precursor protein (APP). Previous studies suggested that Mint/X11 proteins influence APP cleavage and affect production of pathogenic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in Alzheimer's disease; however, the biological significance of Mint/X11 binding to APP and their possible role in Aβ production remain unclear. Here, we crossed conditional and constitutive Mint1, Mint2, and Mint3 knock-out mice with transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease overproducing human Aβ peptides. We show that deletion of all three individual Mint proteins delays the age-dependent production of amyloid plaque numbers and Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels with loss of Mint2 having the largest effect. Acute conditional deletion of all three Mints in cultured neurons suppresses the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments and the secretion of ectodomain APP by decreasing β-cleavage but does not impair subsequent γ-cleavage. These results suggest that the three Mint/X11 proteins regulate Aβ production by a novel mechanism that may have implications for therapeutic approaches to altering APP cleavage in Alzheimer's disease.",2008,50,60,5,0,5,4,1,11,7,6,1,4,4

The free-living soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans shows CO2 avoidance behavior, which requires a pair of ciliated sensory neurons, the BAG neurons. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we show that CO2 specifically activates the BAG neurons and that the CO2-sensing function of BAG neurons requires TAX-2/TAX-4 cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels and the receptor-type guanylate cyclase GCY-9. Our results delineate a molecular pathway for CO2 sensing and suggest that activation of a receptor-type guanylate cyclase is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which animals detect environmental CO2.",2010,54,116,8,0,7,7,17,11,12,8,10,11,14

Under optical irradiation the relative concentration of these centres changes and some new centres are induced such as Ni3+ - Vo + 2e where two electrons have been trapped at the axial Ni3+ - Vo sites. The wavelength dependence of the esr creation and quenching of Ni3+ and Ni3+ - Vo + 2e and the quenching of Ni3+ - Vo has been measured at 77 K. The optical absorption spectra are also reported. Comparison of these results allows certain conclusions to be made about the charge transfer processes that occur under optical irradiation. Evidence is presented that a donor charge transfer process is responsible for the quenching of Ni3+ but both acceptor and donor charge transfer occurs in the creation and quenching of the axial Ni3+ - Vo + 2e centres.",1976,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

A long-standing issue concerns the location of H1 in the chromatin filament7.

Investigations to determine the location of the linker histone based on its access-ibility to antibodies11–15 or immobilized proteases16 under various ionic conditions have yielded conflicting results.

Whereas a near-UV pulse generates a diffraction-limited distribution of excited molecules, a spatially offset pulse quenches the excited molecules from the outer part of the focus through stimulated emission. This results in a subdiffraction-sized effective point-spread function. For a 1.4 aperture and a 388-nm excitation wavelength spatial resolution is increased from 150 +/- 8 nm to 106 +/- 8 nm with a single offset beam. Superior lateral resolution is demonstrated by separation of adjacent Pyridine 2 nanocrystals that are otherwise indiscernible.",1999,7,687,11,1,8,10,3,5,2,7,10,7,10

cc1dc9f3d9b3cf011c0f018081c932808e09ead4,CLASH: PRECISE NEW CONSTRAINTS ON THE MASS PROFILE OF THE GALAXY CLUSTER A2261,"We precisely constrain the inner mass profile of A2261 (z = 0.225) for the first time and determine that this cluster 
is not “overconcentrated” as found previously, implying a formation time in agreement with ΛCDM expectations. 
These results are based on multiple strong-lensing analyses of new 16-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging 
obtained as part of the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble. Combining this with revised weaklensing 
analyses of Subaru wide-field imaging with five-band Subaru + KPNO photometry, we place tight new 
constraints on the halo virial mass Mvir = (2.2 ± 0.2) × 1015 M h−1 
70 (within rvir ≈ 3 Mpc h−1 
70 ) and concentration 
cvir = 6.2 ± 0.3 when assuming a spherical halo. This agrees broadly with average c(M, z) predictions from recent 
ΛCDM simulations, which span 58. Our most significant systematic uncertainty is halo elongation 
along the line of sight (LOS). To estimate this, we also derive a mass profile based on archival Chandra X-ray 
observations and find it to be ∼35% lower than our lensing-derived profile at r2500 ∼ 600 kpc. Agreement can 
be achieved by a halo elongated with a ∼2:1 axis ratio along our LOS. For this elongated halo model, we find 
Mvir = (1.7 ± 0.2) × 1015 M h−1 
70 and cvir = 4.6 ± 0.2, placing rough lower limits on these values. The need 
for halo elongation can be partially obviated by non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic 
errors in the X-ray mass measurements. We estimate the effect of background structures based on MMT/Hectospec 
spectroscopic redshifts and find that these tend to lower Mvir further by ∼7% and increase cvir by ∼5%.

0bef285db7005426ba17963387cf7aac5ffeffe8,Photodegradation of indo-1 and its effect on apparent Ca2+ concentrations.,"BACKGROUND
Fluorescent indicators that show alterations in excitation and/or emission spectra in response to changes in [Ca2+] are widely used for quantitative cytosolic [Ca2+] measurements. There are several reports of changes in apparent [Ca2+] due only to illumination, however. These results have been attributed either to photodamage to the cells or to photodegradation of the indicator. Light-induced alteration in the behavior of the dye or cells would severely hamper the interpretation of experimental data. We examined this phenomenon in indo-1 loaded cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy.


RESULTS
Illumination of indo-1 loaded GH3 cells leads to a decrease in apparent basal [Ca2+] and decreased peaks after depolarization with KCl. When cells were double loaded with indo-1 and fluo-3, the effect of UV illumination was noticed only with the former dye. UV irradiation of indo-1 in simple buffers caused overall photobleaching and conversion to a fluorescent but Ca2+-insensitive species. The latter effect cannot be canceled by ratiometric calibration and is due to loss of carboxymethyl groups from the anilino nitrogens. This photodegradation was inhibited by extracellular administration of 10 to 100 microM Trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E analog.


CONCLUSIONS
Photodegradation processes like that observed for indo-1 are likely to be possible for all cation indicators that contain bis(carboxymethyl)anilino moieties, which include essentially all fluorescent indicators for Ca2+ and Mg2+ currently in biological use. If unrecognized, this photochemical dealkylation leads to an underestimation of the analyte concentrations depending on the intensity and duration of illumination. The problem can be avoided by including cell-permeant antioxidants such as Trolox in the bathing solution. The ultimate solution would be to redesign the indicators to minimize photodegradation in the absence of antioxidants.",1996,26,76,5,0,3,5,12,1,1,1,3,1,4

The measurement was performed on the Hamlet chondrite that fell in Indiana on October 13, 1959. The ratio of the 35-day argon 37 to the 325-year argon 39 was found to be 2.0±0.3. The relative production rates for these isotopes was determined by bombarding the meteorite with 3-bev protons. The ratio of the argon 37 to argon 39 production rates was found to be 1.5±0.2. Since the ratios were the same within experimental uncertainty, it was concluded that the flux of cosmic radiation is constant in the space between the earth and the asteroidal belt. The argon 39 contents of four other chondrites were measured. The values obtained were as follows: Richardton 7.1±0.6, Murray 9.4±0.5, Forest City 11.9±0.5, Benton 9.0±0.4, and Hamlet 7.8±0.2 dis/min kg.",1960,8,34,0,0,2,5,2,2,3,1,2,0,3

Our purpose was to extend observations on mouthpiece breathing to its effects on the cardiorespiratory response to intense exercise and to develop and validate an algorithm for computer-assisted analysis of breathing pattern recorded with respiratory inductive plethysmography. Six normal men performed incremental bicycle exercise to volitional exhaustion on two occasions with and without mouthpiece and noseclip. ECG and breathing pattern recorded with a respiratory inductive plethysmograph were analyzed manually and with computer assistance. Mouthpiece breathing increased tidal volume and respiratory cycle time by up to 63 and 33% respectively (p < 0.02) during mild exercise, but it did not alter performance, heart rate, or breathing pattern at maximal exercise. Mean differences between inductive plethysmographic and spirometric tidal volumes were < 5% during validation at rest and maximal exercise. Application of the proposed algorithm for semiautomatic breathing pattern analysis provided significant time savings with no loss in precision compared with manual analysis. In conclusion, in normal men, performance and breathing pattern during maximal exercise are not altered by a mouthpiece and noseclip, and accurate computer-assisted measurement of ventilation from external transducers may be performed even during intense exercise.",1995,0,29,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,2

Previous work on the isolated muscle has made it clear(1 & 9) that in an isometric twitch the force developed (T) is a measure of the mechanical energy liberated, and that T is related to H, the total energy set free, by certain comparatively simple relations when the temperature, strength of shock, and initial length are varied (2). In a twitch there is evidence(1, p. 151) that the theoretical maximum work of a muscle (i.e. the potential energy set free) is some constant fraction of Tl, I being the length of the muscle; and in the case of the frog's sartorius, this fraction was found(9) to be about J. The proportion existing between the mechanical energy available, and the quantity Ti, has been confirmed by D oi (5, p. 340), employing a ""maximum works"" device described by myself (3 & 4); Doi showed that W, the maximum work performed when a frog's sartorius is allowed to shorten, bears a constant ratio to T, the force developed when the muscle carries out an isometric contraction in response to the same shock, and under the same initial conditions. In actual practice however the maximum realisable work was much less than T1/6, viz. at 150 about -043 Ti. The difference would seem to be due to the phenomenon described by Hartree and Hill(6), who found that when the length of a muscle is altered passively a considerable quantity of heat is evolved, which is greater the more sudden the change of length; this degradation of mechanical energy they ascribed to viscous resistance to a change of form, and it is obvious that any agency which degrades mechanical energy into heat when a muscle changes its form passively must work equally when the change of form is caused by the activity of the muscle itself. The response therefore of a frog's muscle to a single shock is so rapid that only about j of the total",1922,3,266,11,1,1,1,0,0,0,3,1,4,0

Here, we use suppression subtractive hybridization to identify a previously unrecognized SREBP-enhanced gene in mice. The gene encodes a membrane-bound enzyme that we designate SCALD, for short-chain aldehyde reductase. We expressed SCALD in bacteria, purified it extensively, and studied its catalytic properties in detergent solution. The enzyme specifically uses NADPH to reduce a variety of short-chain aldehydes, including nonanal and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. The enzyme also reduces retinaldehydes, showing equal activity for all-trans-retinal and 9-cis-retinal. Northern blot analysis indicates that SCALD is expressed most abundantly in mouse liver and testis. In the liver of mice, SCALD is suppressed by fasting and induced by refeeding, consistent with regulation by SREBPs. In testis, SCALD expression is restricted to pachytene spermatocytes, as revealed by visualization of mRNA and protein. SCALD is also expressed in four layers of the retina, including the outer segment of rods and cones, as revealed by immunohistochemistry. SCALD appears to be the mouse ortholog of the human protein that has been designated variously as prostate short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1, retinal reductase 1, and retinol dehydrogenase 11. In view of its ability to reduce short-chain aldehydes in addition to retinals, we propose that SCALD may be induced by SREBP in liver and other tissues to prevent toxicity from fatty aldehydes that are generated from oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids that are synthesized as a result of SREBP activity.",2003,38,44,2,2,4,1,3,1,4,2,3,0,5

4c398da2c7ad36e610725c89509a49bc8dc3e63f,Agonist-induced conformational changes in bovine rhodopsin: insight into activation of G-protein-coupled receptors.,"Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is initiated by conformational changes in the transmembrane (TM) helices and the intra- and extracellular loops induced by ligand binding. Understanding the conformational changes in GPCRs leading to activation is imperative in deciphering the role of these receptors in the pathology of diseases. Since the crystal structures of activated GPCRs are not yet available, computational methods and biophysical techniques have been used to predict the structures of GPCR active states. We have recently applied the computational method LITiCon to understand the ligand-induced conformational changes in beta(2)-adrenergic receptor by ligands of varied efficacies. Here we report a study of the conformational changes associated with the activation of bovine rhodopsin for which the crystal structure of the inactive state is known. Starting from the inactive (dark) state, we have predicted the TM conformational changes that are induced by the isomerization of 11-cis retinal to all-trans retinal leading to the fully activated state, metarhodopsin II. The predicted active state of rhodopsin satisfies all of the 30 known experimental distance constraints. The predicted model also correlates well with the experimentally observed conformational switches in rhodopsin and other class A GPCRs, namely, the breaking of the ionic lock between R135(3.50) at the intracellular end of TM3 (part of the DRY motif) and E247(6.30) on TM6, and the rotamer toggle switch on W265(6.48) on TM6. We observe that the toggling of the W265(6.48) rotamer modulates the bend angle of TM6 around the conserved proline. The rotamer toggling is facilitated by the formation of a water wire connecting S298(7.45), W265(6.48) and H211(5.46). As a result, the intracellular ends of TMs 5 and 6 move outward from the protein core, causing large conformational changes at the cytoplasmic interface. The predicted outward movements of TM5 and TM6 are in agreement with the recently published crystal structure of opsin, which is proposed to be close to the active-state structure. In the predicted active state, several residues in the intracellular loops, such as R69, V139(3.54), T229, Q237, Q239, S240, T243 and V250(6.33), become more water exposed compared to the inactive state. These residues may be involved in mediating the conformational signal from the receptor to the G protein. From mutagenesis studies, some of these residues, such as V139(3.54), T229 and V250(6.33), are already implicated in G-protein activation. The predicted active state also leads to the formation of new stabilizing interhelical hydrogen-bond contacts, such as those between W265(6.48) and H211(5.46) and E122(3.37) and C167(4.56). These hydrogen-bond contacts serve as potential conformational switches offering new opportunities for future experimental investigations. The calculated retinal binding energy surface shows that binding of an agonist makes the receptor dynamic and flexible and accessible to many conformations, while binding of an inverse agonist traps the receptor in the inactive state and makes the other conformations inaccessible.",2008,48,78,5,1,13,15,8,11,8,2,6,4,3

Linkers II and III consist of five and six ethyleneglycol units, respectively. The melting temperatures of the cross-linked duplexes are 65 degrees C for I and 73 degrees C for II and III, as compared with 36 degrees C for the corresponding non-linked nonadeoxynucleotide duplex.

Individual trajectories of length up to 5 ns sample only a fraction of the conformational distribution generated by ten independent 120 ps trajectories at 300 K. The backbone atom conformational space distribution is analyzed using principal components analysis (PCA). Four different major conformational regions are found. In general, a trajectory samples only one region and few transitions between the regions are observed. Consequently, the averages of structural and dynamic properties over the ten trajectories differ significantly from those obtained from individual trajectories. The nature of the conformational sampling has important consequences for the utilization of MD simulations for a wide range of problems, such as comparisons with X‐ray or NMR data. The overall average structure is significantly closer to the X‐ray structure than any of the individual trajectory average structures. The high frequency (less than 10 ps) atomic fluctuations from the ten trajectories tend to be similar, but the lower frequency (100 ps) motions are different. To improve conformational sampling in molecular dynamics simulations of proteins, as in nucleic acids, multiple trajectories with different initial conditions should be used rather than a single long trajectory.",1998,92,391,9,1,10,13,12,11,12,11,10,15,12

A 1.5 cm. test-tube is a convenient size to use. The capillary should be about 1.0 by 5 ram. inside dimensions and as uniformly rectangular in cross-section as possible. I t is then sealed to short pieces of glass tubing as shown in Fig. 2, and the whole connected with the Zn-ZnSO4 electrodes as previously described. ~ Slight curvature of the glass may be overcome by sealing cover-slips with Canada balsam to the top and bottom of the cell. In using the cell the potential drop per cm. in the cell itself must be known. This may be calculated from the cell dimensions as previously described 1 or measured directly. For direct measurement two small platinum electrodes are sealed into the cell about 2 can. apart, and the potential drop per cm. which occurs in the cell itself is determined by measuring the potential between these electrodes with an electrometer? This measurement may also be made with a potentiometer provided the apparatus is filled with mercury. The cell is assembled and filled with dry mercury. A dry cell is connected in series with the two Zn electrodes and the potential between these electrodes determined with a potentiometer. The potential between the electrodes sealed into the cell is also determined. This gives the propor-",1925,0,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2

Here we report that the CAF-1 protein complex, an evolutionarily conserved histone chaperone that deposits histone H3-H4 proteins onto replicating DNA, is required to generate a bilateral asymmetry in the C. elegans nervous system. A mutation in 1 of 24 C. elegans histone H3 genes specifically eliminates this aspect of neuronal asymmetry by causing a defect in the formation of a histone H3-H4 tetramer and the consequent inhibition of CAF-1-mediated nucleosome formation. Our results reveal that replication-coupled nucleosome assembly is necessary to generate a bilateral asymmetry in C. elegans neuroanatomy and suggest that left-right asymmetric epigenetic regulation can establish bilateral asymmetry in the nervous system.",2011,62,91,2,0,10,13,14,11,8,10,13,5,4

This substance is contained in the active yeast-juice prepared by disintegrating living yeast, and, therefore, most probably exists in the yeast cell side by side with the zymase. The occurrence of an analogous activating substance has been described by Magnus in the case of the lipase of the liver. He observed that the active juice of this organ became inactive when dialysed into water, but regained its activity when the dialysate or boiled liver juice was added. The term coferment was suggested by Bertrand to denote substances of this kind, and he applied it in two instances—to the calcium salt, which he considered was necessary for the action of pectase on pecten substances, and to the manganese of laccase, which he supposed to be essential for the activity of this enzyme.

In addition to recognizing non-native conformations, these quality control factors distinguish substrates that can be refolded from those that need to be degraded. To investigate the molecular basis of this process, we have solved the crystal structure of DegP (also known as HtrA), a widely conserved heat shock protein that combines refolding and proteolytic activities. The DegP hexamer is formed by staggered association of trimeric rings. The proteolytic sites are located in a central cavity that is only accessible laterally. The mobile side-walls are constructed by twelve PDZ domains, which mediate the opening and closing of the particle and probably the initial binding of substrate. The inner cavity is lined by several hydrophobic patches that may act as docking sites for unfolded polypeptides.

With the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces, analogous processes should occur for intense neutrino fluxes as for photon fluxes. Intense EM waves excite parametric instabilities in nonlinear media and plasma in particular. Therefore, sufficiently intense neutrino fluxes should also cause similar parametric instabilities in dense plasmas. An important example is the production of Langmuir plasmons and lower energy neutrinos. In plasma physics, for electromagnetic waves, the process is known as stimulated Raman scattering and it greatly increases the interaction of the light with the plasma. We propose that the analogous process, for neutrinos, occurs in the plasma surrounding the core of a supernova due to the immense neutrino flux there and the fact that at some distance from the core the flux is strongly unidirectional. We develop a theory for stimulated scattering of neutrinos in plasmas based on the index of refraction for neutrinos which depends on electron density, conservation of energy and momentum for neutrinos plus plasmons and wave damping; we estimate approximate growth rates.",1994,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The selectivity filter is identical to the Streptomyces lividans K+ channel within error of measurement (r.m.s.d.<0.2 Å), suggesting that K+ selectivity requires extreme conservation of three‐dimensional structure.

In contrast, here we provide data from field populations of a major crop pest, African armyworm (Spodoptera exempta), which show that the prevalence and intensity of infection with a nucleopolydrovirus (SpexNPV) is positively associated with infection with three strains of Wolbachia. We also use laboratory bioassays to demonstrate that infection with one of these strains, a male-killer, increases host mortality due to SpexNPV by 6-14 times.

fa68a6bc5117e29bf2d83f728dc5106a0e40854f,The Wehnelt Kathode in a High Vacuum,"I AM glad to learn Prof. Richardson's view is much the same as that expressed in my letter to NATURE of November 21, 1907, that the currents in question are carried mainly by the residual gas, not by the electrons expelled from the kathode. Into the views that have been expressed in earlier communications it is therefore unnecessary to enter; but certainly Prof. J. J. Thomson has recognised the important part played by the residual gas, for example, in his lecture reported in NATURE of March 22, 1906. So far as I have yet been able to see, the action of the residual gas in the passage of large currents is much the same whether a Wehnelt kathode or an ordinary electrode is used. There appears to be a definite pressure at which the conductivity is a maximum, and a steady diminution of conductivity when this pressure is either increased or diminished. I do not think, with large currents at least, there is a sudden drop in the discharge current when the pressure is gradually reduced. Of course in the experiment I quoted there was a sudden cessation of the current, but then there is a sudden absorption of the residual gas when the calcium volatilises. The practical difficulties in the way of maintaining a high vacuum in an apparatus containing incandescent bodies by ordinary methods probably led to the earlier view that it was possible to make a vacuum a good conductor by use of an incandescent kathode.",1907,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Atomic distribution functions from a molecular dynamics simulation for lysozyme are introduced into a real-space (electron density) refinement procedure for individual atoms. Several models for the atomic probability distributions are examined. When isotropic, harmonic motion is assumed, the largest discrepancies between the true first moments (means) and second moments (B factors) of the positions calculated from the dynamics and the fitted values occur for probability densities with multiple peaks. The refined mean is at the center of the largest peak, and the refined B factor is slightly larger than that of the largest peak, unless the distance between the peaks is small compared to the peak width. The resulting values are often significantly different from the true first and second moments of the distribution.

Houssay (I) has summarized these studies. Asthenia is one of the most characteristic signs of hypophyseal insufficiency in this toad. The asthenia involves the locomotor system, smooth muscle organs and heart. It is apparently due to profound metabolic disturbances which lead to death in nearly all cases 2 to 6 weeks afterremoval of the hypophysis. The asthenia is also observed in other batrachians, but it is particularly characteristic in Bufo arenarum due to its severity and prolonged period of evolution (2–6).",1941,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The gate's response to voltage is mediated by voltage sensors, which are arginine-containing structures that must move with respect to the membrane electric field. We have analysed by electron microscopy a voltage-dependent K+ channel from Aeropyrum pernix (KvAP). Fab fragments were attached to ‘voltage sensor paddles’ and identified in the electron microscopy map at 10.5 Å resolution. The extracellular surface location of the Fab fragments in the map is consistent with the membrane-depolarized, open conformation of the channel in electrophysiological experiments. Comparison of the map with a crystal structure demonstrates that the voltage sensor paddles are ‘up’ (that is, near the channel's extracellular surface) and situated at the protein–lipid interface. This finding supports the hypothesis that in response to changes in voltage the sensors move at the protein–lipid interface rather than in a gating pore surrounded by protein.",2004,60,126,3,7,28,17,6,10,6,5,6,6,6

We have recently shown that the interaction of spinophilin with the actin cytoskeleton depends upon phosphorylation by protein kinase A. We have now found that spinophilin is phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in neurons. Ca2+/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II, located within the post‐synaptic density of dendritic spines, is known to play a role in synaptic plasticity and is ideally positioned to regulate spinophilin. Using tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, site‐directed mutagenesis and microsequencing analysis, we identified two sites of CaMKII phosphorylation (Ser‐100 and Ser‐116) within the actin‐binding domain of spinophilin. Phosphorylation by CaMKII reduced the affinity of spinophilin for F‐actin. In neurons, phosphorylation at Ser‐100 by CaMKII was Ca2+ dependent and was associated with an enrichment of spinophilin in the synaptic plasma membrane fraction. These results indicate that spinophilin is phosphorylated by multiple kinases in vivo and that differential phosphorylation may target spinophilin to specific locations within dendritic spines.",2004,59,58,4,1,9,2,3,8,4,1,1,3,3

The closed configuration of the DNA gives rise to the fast band (component I) and the open configuration to a slow band, which is in some cases double (components II and III). Components I and II are able to produce plaques on mouse embryo monolayers, i.e., they possess cytocidal activity but which of the components cause cell transformation could not be determined owing to the lack of an adequate quantitative assay for transformation. A determination of the role of these DNA components in transformation is important, since it may clarify the mechanism of transformation. Such a determination is now made possible by the development of a sensitive quantitative assay for transformation caused by polyoma virus. This method is based on the ability of the transformed cells to form colonies in agar where the vast majority of the untransformed cells are unable to form colonies. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that this method is also suitable for the study of the transforming ability of polyoma DNA.",1964,2,41,0,1,3,3,6,3,2,0,3,3,1

We describe here the binding of quercetagetin (3,3',4',5,6,7-hydroxyflavone), related flavonoids, and SP600125 to JNK1 and PI3-K by ATP-competitive and immobilized metal ion affinity-based fluorescence polarization assays and measure the effect of quercetagetin on JNK1 and PI3-K activities. Quercetagetin attenuated the phosphorylation of c-Jun and AKT, suppressed AP-1 and NF-κB promoter activities, and also reduced cell transformation. It attenuated tumor incidence and reduced tumor volumes in a two-stage skin carcinogenesis mouse model. Our crystallographic structure determination data show that quercetagetin binds to the ATP-binding site of JNK1. Notably, the interaction between Lys55, Asp169, and Glu73 of JNK1 and the catechol moiety of quercetagetin reorients the N-terminal lobe of JNK1, thereby improving compatibility of the ligand with its binding site. The results of a theoretical docking study suggest a binding mode of PI3-K with the hydroxyl groups of the catechol moiety forming hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asp964 and Asp841 in the p110γ catalytic subunit. These interactions could contribute to the high inhibitory activity of quercetagetin against PI3-K.

We have examined 20 different individuals from 10 spherocytosis kindreds and 2 elliptocytosis kindreds to determine the effects of different levels of spectrin deficiency on the viscoelastic properties of the erythrocyte membrane. Micropipettes were used to perform single-cell micromechanical measurements of approximately 1,000 individual cells to determine the membrane elastic shear modulus, the apparent membrane bending stiffness, and whole cell recovery time constant for the different cell populations. The membrane viscosity was calculated by the product of the shear modulus and the recovery time constant. Results show correlation between the fractional reduction in shear modulus and the fractional reduction in spectrin content (determined by spectrin radioimmunoassay) and spectrin density (determined by the ratios of spectrin to band 3 on electrophoresis gels) suggesting that membrane shear elasticity is directly proportional to the surface density of spectrin on the membrane (P less than 0.001). The apparent membrane bending stiffness is also reduced in proportion to the density of spectrin (P less than 0.001). The membrane viscosity is reduced relative to control (P less than 0.001), but the nature of the relationship between spectrin density and membrane viscosity is less clearly defined.

In this study, ectodermal precursor cells (EPCs) with the capacity to cross talk with hair-inductive dermal cells were generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and assessed for HF-forming ability in vivo. EPCs derived from three hiPSC lines generated with 4 or 3 factors (POU5F1, SOX2, KLF4 +/- MYC) mostly expressed keratin 18, a marker of epithelial progenitors. When cocultured with human dermal papilla (DP) cells, a 4 factor 201B7 hiPSC-EPC line upregulated follicular keratinocyte (KC) markers more significantly than normal human adult KCs (NHKCs) and other hiPSC-EPC lines. DP cells preferentially increased DP biomarker expression in response to this line. Interestingly, 201B7 hiPSCs were shown to be ectodermal/epithelial prone, and the derived EPCs were putatively in a wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT)-activated state. Importantly, co-transplantation of 201B7 hiPSC-EPCs, but not NHKCs, with trichogenic mice dermal cells into immunodeficient mice resulted in HF formation. Human HF stem cell markers were detected in reconstituted HFs; however, a low frequency of human-derived cells implied that hiPSC-EPCs contributed to HF morphogenesis via direct repopulation and non-cell autonomous activities. The current study suggests a, to our knowledge, previously unrecognized advantage of using hiPSCs to enhance epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in HF bioengineering.",2013,53,49,2,4,7,5,5,5,5,6,5,7,0

The fucosyl glycopeptides elute in two major regions: one near the void volume, the other in fractions corresponding to a molecular weight of 2500–3000. These elution profiles are very different from those obtained with the other human cell lines examined which included 3 lymphomas, 2 colon carcinomas, and HeLa. The elution profiles of the human teratomas, however, show remarkable similarities to those obtained with murine embryonal carcinoma cell culture and early mouse embryos. These results suggest that the excluded G-50 fraction may well contain glycopeptides playing a role in mammalian embryogenesis.",1979,10,19,0,0,0,2,3,3,2,3,0,0,0

The abundance sensitivity of the mass spectrometer for the measured ion beams of Lu{sup +} was examined to ensure the absence of tailing effects and interfering ion beams. The isotope fractionation of the measured {sup 176}Lu/{sup 175}Lu ratio was estimated with reference to the isotope fractionation of ytterbium (whose isotopes are in the same mass region as lutetium), which was recently measured in this laboratory using gravimetrically prepared solutions of the enriched isotopes {sup 171}Yb and {sup 176}Yb. This is the first reported publication in which the measured isotope ratio of Lu has been corrected for isotope fractionation. An accurate determination of the abundance of {sup 176}Lu is required because of the importance of this isotope in cosmochronometry, cosmothermometry, and s-process branching studies. An accurate abundance of {sup 176}Lu is also required as it is the parent nuclide of the {sup 176}Lu/{sup 176}Hf geochronometer. The measured isotopic composition of Lu, corrected for isotope fractionation, is {sup 176}Lu/{sup 175}Lu =more » 0.026680 {+-} 0.000013, which gives isotope abundances for {sup 175}Lu of 97.4013 {+-} 0.0012% and of {sup 176}Lu of 2.5987 {+-} 0.0012%. The isotope abundances and relative atomic masses of the two isotopes give an atomic weight of 174.9668 {+-} 0.0001, which is in good agreement with the present Standard Atomic Weight A{sub r}(Lu) = 174.967 {+-} 0.001, but with improved accuracy. An accurate assessment of the {sup 176}Lu/{sup 175}Lu ratio is important in order to calculate the Solar System abundances of {sup 175}Lu and {sup 176}Lu for astrophysical evaluations. The experimentally determined Solar System abundances for {sup 175}Lu and {sup 176}Lu of 0.0347918 {+-} 0.0000004 and 0.0009282 {+-} 0.0000004, respectively (as compared to silicon equals 10{sup 6} atoms), should now be used for these purposes. This determination of the isotopic composition of Lu also demonstrates that the presently accepted half-life of {sup 176}Lu needs to be reevaluated.« less",2006,28,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

At higher concentrations there is an increase in the average cell volume. However, by serial subculture in media containing increasing quantities of D 2 O the cells can be adapted to grow well at about 60% D 2 O, and even show some growth at 99% D 2 O. The relative incorporation into cell material of protons and deuterons from the medium has been determined with both adapted and unadapted cells. The distribution in a number of compounds of 14 C incorporated from 14 CO 2 during photosynthesis has been investigated using unadapted and adapted cells suspended in distilled water of varying D 2 O contents. The effect on the 14 CO 2 incorporation patterns of adapting cells to grow in 60% D 2 O, and then subculturing them in lower concentrations of heavy water has also been examined. Certain conclusions have been drawn as to the effect of D 2 O on the pattern of 14 CO 2 incorporation, and an effort has been made to distinguish between those effects due solely to the presence of deuterium in the medium and in the exchangeable hydrogen atoms in the macro-molecules, and those effects resulting from a utilization of deuterium for general synthetic processes.",1958,7,33,0,3,2,8,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

The objectives of the experiments in this paper were to evaluate the in vitro inhibición of viral DNA polymerase (DNAp) among (1) different species of Phyllanthus; (2) within the most promising species; and (3) to evaluate differences in activity that might be correlated with environmental effects. The ultimate goal of our studies is to develop a system for producing high quality plants for large scale extraction.Inhibitory activity varied significantly among species. InP. urinaria there were also significant differences among intraspecific accessions. Accessions ofP. amarus from various locations did not differ significantly. Experiments with one seedlot showed highly significant plant-to-plant differences in anti-viral activity, but clear-cut heritable differences were not established among progeny of the plants at extremes in the distribution. Differences in general soil fertility, soil moisture, pH or Ca generally did not significantly affect inhibición of viral DNAp but temperature differences did. Except for temperature, the detectable environmental effects were generally less than the size of the genetic differences among species.P. amarus was successfully grown as a row crop with inputs of fertilizer and irrigation and showed no loss of activity when compared to samples from the wild. Thus, once an accession of Phyllanthus with potent inhibición of viral DNAp is identified, it can be grown under cultivated conditions for extraction without a loss of activity.RésuméExtractosde Phyllanthus amarus (Euforbiaceae), reducieron o eliminaron los antigenos superficiales del virus hepatitis B en humanos o los antigenos superficiales de virus de la hepatitis de marmota en marmotas.

Ensayos para probar diferentes condiciones en el suelo, como por ejemplo fertilidad general, humedad del suelo, pH o nivel de Ca, por lo general no mostraron un efecto significativo sobre la inhibitión del DNAp viral, sino la temperatura ambiental, sí. Cuando existieron efectos ambientales significativos, fueron menores que los efectos genéticos vistos en los otros experimentos, con la excepción del efecto de temperatura. Plantas de P. amarus de buena calidadfueron obtenidas sembradas en hueras y usando abono y riego por goteo.

Despite their key position in the cortical microcircuit, synaptic integration in dendrites of L2/3 neurons is far less understood than in L5 pyramidal cell dendrites, mainly because of the difficulties in obtaining electrical recordings from thin dendrites. Here we directly measured passive and active properties of the apical dendrites of L2/3 neurons in rat brain slices using dual dendritic–somatic patch-clamp recordings and calcium imaging. Unlike L5 cells, L2/3 dendrites displayed little sag in response to long current pulses, which suggests a low density of Ih in the dendrites and soma. This was also consistent with a slight increase in input resistance with distance from the soma. Brief current injections into the apical dendrite evoked relatively short (half-width 2–4 ms) dendritic spikes that were isolated from the soma for near-threshold currents at sites beyond the middle of the apical dendrite. Regenerative dendritic potentials and large concomitant calcium transients were also elicited by trains of somatic action potentials (APs) above a critical frequency (130 Hz), which was slightly higher than in L5 neurons. Initiation of dendritic spikes was facilitated by backpropagating somatic APs and could cause an additional AP at the soma. As in L5 neurons, we found that distal dendritic calcium transients are sensitive to a long-lasting block by GABAergic inhibition. We conclude that L2/3 pyramidal neurons can generate dendritic spikes, sharing with L5 pyramidal neurons fundamental properties of dendritic excitability and control by inhibition.",2007,61,181,9,0,10,13,13,13,15,9,13,8,18

The potassium persulfate concentration was varied over the range from 15.75 to 157.5 mmol/l, and that of the initial monomer, from 0.462 to 2.675 mol/l, while the concentration of silver nitrate was 31.5 mmol/l. Both the polymerization rate and the molecular weight of the polymer were found to increase with the reaction time in the early stage, while in the stage of higher conversion the polymerization rate was gradually reduced and the molecular weight remained constant. In the early stage of the polymerization, the polymer yield showed a first-order dependence on the potassium persulfate and initial monomer concentrations. The molecular weight of the polymer was proportional to the monomer concentration, independent of the catalyst concentration.

Quantitative and reversible electrochemical reactions were obtained at a surface‐modified electrode for all cofactors as indicated by the optical signals in the 400–700 nm range. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectra of reduction and oxidation (reduced‐minus‐oxidized and oxidized‐minus‐reduced, respectively) obtained in the 1800‐1000 cm−1 range reveal highly structured band features with major contributions in the amide I (1620–1680 cm−1) and amide II (1580‐1520 cm−1) range which indicate structural rearrangements in the cofactor vicinity. However, the small amplitude of the IR difference signals indicates that these conformational changes are small and affect only individual peptide groups. In the spectral region above 1700 cm−1, a positive peak in the reduced state (1733 cm−1) and negative peak in the oxidized state (1745 cm−1) are characteristic for the formation and decay of a COOH mode upon reduction. The most obvious interpretation of this difference signal is proton uptake by one Asp or Gin side chain carboxyl group in the reduced state and deprotonation of another Asp or Glu residue. Moreover, both residues could well be coupled as a donor‐acceptor pair in the proton transfer chain. An alternative interpretation is in terms of a protonated carboxyl group which shifts to a different environment in the reduced state. The relevance of this first direct observation of protein protonation changes in the cytochrome c oxidase for vectorial proton transfer and the catalytic reaction is discussed.",1996,27,77,1,1,4,3,7,1,2,9,4,4,2

To clarify the physiological roles of TRAF3, we introduced a TRAF3 null mutation in mice through homologous recombination. TRAF3-deficient mice appear normal at birth but become progressively runted, correlating with progressive hypoglycemia and depletion of peripheral white cells. The mutant mice die by 10 days of age. Fetal liver cells from TRAF3-deficient embryos can reconstitute all hematopoietic lineages in lethally irradiated mice. However, these reconstituted mice are impaired in their immune responses to T-dependent antigen, and their T cells are functionally defective.

a40f4f19a9868eee3739653a410f891c5c4b92aa,Triazoles inhibit cholesterol export from lysosomes by binding to NPC1,"Significance In animal cells, cholesterol is essential for the assembly of membranes and production of steroid hormones and bile acids. Cells obtain cholesterol through receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL into lysosomes. After lysosomal degradation, LDL-derived cholesterol must cross the lysosomal membrane to execute its functions. Lysosomal export is mediated by Niemann–Pick C1 (NPC1), a membrane protein. Here we show that the triazole drugs posaconazole and itraconazole inhibit lysosomal cholesterol export. A photoactivatable derivative of posaconazole cross-links to NPC1 in intact cells and to purified NPC1 in lipid nanodiscs. A point mutation in the membrane domain of NPC1 prevents lysosomal export of cholesterol and blocks posaconazole cross-linking. Niemann–Pick C1 (NPC1), a membrane protein of lysosomes, is required for the export of cholesterol derived from receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL. Lysosomal cholesterol export is reportedly inhibited by itraconazole, a triazole that is used as an antifungal drug [Xu et al. (2010) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107:4764–4769]. Here we show that posaconazole, another triazole, also blocks cholesterol export from lysosomes. We prepared P-X, a photoactivatable cross-linking derivative of posaconazole. P-X cross-linked to NPC1 when added to intact cells. Cross-linking was inhibited by itraconazole but not by ketoconazole, an imidazole that does not block cholesterol export. Cross-linking of P-X was also blocked by U18666A, a compound that has been shown to bind to NPC1 and inhibit cholesterol export. P-X also cross-linked to purified NPC1 that was incorporated into lipid bilayer nanodiscs. In this in vitro system, cross-linking of P-X was inhibited by itraconazole, but not by U18666A. P-X cross-linking was not prevented by deletion of the N-terminal domain of NPC1, which contains the initial binding site for cholesterol. In contrast, P-X cross-linking was reduced when NPC1 contained a point mutation (P691S) in its putative sterol-sensing domain. We hypothesize that the sterol-sensing domain has a binding site that can accommodate structurally different ligands.",2016,39,38,1,0,2,3,6,17,10,0,0,0,0

Oplophorus luciferase has now been obtained in a highly purified state. Optimum luminescence occurs at pH 9 in the presence of 0.05--0.1 M NaCl at 40 degrees C, and, due to the unusual resistance of this enzyme to heat, visible luminescence occurs at temperatures above 70 degrees C when partially purified enzyme is used. The specific activity of purest preparations is 1.75 X 10(15) photons s-1 mg-1 at 23 degrees C. At pH 8.7, native luciferase has a molecular weight of approximately 130 000, apparently comprising 4 monomers of 31 000; at lower pHs, the native luciferase tends to polymerize. The quantum yield of coelenterazine is 0.34 at 22 degrees C with this enzyme. After the luminescent reaction, the spent solution is nonfluorescent, and likewise solutions of luciferase alone. When the bioluminescent reaction was carried out in the presence of 18O2, the product CO2 contained more than 50% C18O16O, supporting the dioxetane mechanism, but without ruling out the linear peroxide mechanism.",1978,23,84,1,0,5,1,1,3,1,1,1,0,0

Intravenous infusion of FR139317 at 0.2 (n = 4) or 0.6 mg kg−1 min−1 (n = 4) inhibited the ET‐1 pressor response by 83 or 89%, respectively. Infusion of PD 145065 at 0.2 (n = 4) or 0.6 mg kg−1 min−1 (n = 4) inhibited the ET‐1‐induced increase in MAP by 79 or 75%, respectively. 3 The transient depressor response (−16 ± 3 mmHg) which preceded the rise in blood pressure induced by ET‐1 (1 nmol kg−1, i.a., n = 8) was enhanced by an intravenous infusion of FR139317 (0.6 mg kg−1 min−1) to −35 ± 5 mmHg (P < 0.05, n = 4). This enhancement was abolished by indomethacin (5 mg kg−1, i.v.) pretreatment (−17 ± 1 mmHg, n = 4). PD145065 (0.2 mg kg−1 min−1, i.v.) attenuated the ET‐1‐induced fall in blood pressure to −9 ± 1 mmHg (n = 4), while a higher dose of this antagonist (0.6 mg kg−1 min−1, i.v.) completely abolished the ET‐1‐mediated depressor response. 4 ET‐1 (1 nmol kg−1, n = 8) inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation by 96% at 5 min after injection of the peptide. FR139317 (0.2 or 0.6 mg kg−1 min−1, i.v.) or PD145065 (0.2 mg kg−1 min−1, i.v.) did not affect the inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to ET‐1. In contrast, intravenous infusion of PD145065 (0.6 mg kg−1 min−1) abolished the anti‐aggregatory effects of ET‐1. 5 Thus, FR139317 inhibits the pressor, but not the depressor actions of ET‐1 and has no effect on the ET‐1‐induced inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation. In contrast, PD145065 antagonizes the pressor and depressor responses to ET‐1 and abolishes the anti‐aggregatory effects of the peptide. 6 These results strongly suggest that ET‐1‐induced vasoconstriction in the anaesthetized rabbit is primarily mediated via the ETA receptor while the depressor and antiaggregatory actions of ET‐1 are due to activation of the ETB receptor.",1993,38,28,1,0,7,3,2,1,2,1,2,4,1

Limited proteolysis of PrP(Sc) produces an N-terminally truncated polypeptide of about 142 residues, designated PrP 27-30. Recently, a recombinant protein (rPrP) of 142 residues corresponding to the Syrian hamster PrP 27-30 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified (Mehlhorn et al., 1996). rPrP has been refolded into both alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures as well as various intermediates in aqueous buffers. The beta-sheet state and two pH-dependent alpha-helical states were characterized by CD and NMR. The alpha-helical conformation occurred only after the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, whereas the beta-sheet form was accessible either with or without the disulfide. Of the different alpha-helical forms studied, only those refolded in the pH range 5-8 were substantially soluble at physiological pH, exhibiting similar conformations and monomeric analytical sedimentation profiles throughout the above pH range. Furthermore, refolded alpha-rPrP showed NMR chemical shift dispersion typical of proteins with native conformations, although 2D NMR indicated large segments of conformational flexibility. It displayed a cooperative thermal denaturation transition; at elevated temperatures, it converted rapidly and irreversibly to the thermodynamically more stable beta-sheet form. Unfolding of alpha-rPrP by GdnHCl revealed a two-phase transition with a relatively stable folding intermediate at 2 M GdnHCl. The deltaG values were estimated to be 1.9 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol for the first phase and 6.5 +/- 1.2 kcal/mol for the second, consistent with a folding core surrounded by significant segments of flexible conformation. By NMR, alpha-rPrP(acid) isolated at pH 2 without refolding exhibited heterogeneous line widths, consistent with an acid-denatured molten globular state. We conclude that to the extent that rPrP constitutes a relevant folding domain of PrP(C), the various conformations exhibited by rPrP suggest that the PrP sequence may be intrinsically plastic in its conformations; indeed, portions of PrP(C) may possess a relatively open conformation which makes it susceptible to conversion into PrP(Sc) under appropriate conditions.",1997,0,148,2,7,12,13,5,19,8,7,6,10,3

Healthy male Japanese college students, 19–20 yr old, served as volunteer test subjects. Intravenous administration of 0.50 or 0.75 pressor units of LVP-Dimer, at 4:00 pm, induced a significant elevation in plasma cortisol level. The maximal response was usually observed 30 min after injection. The action of LVP-Dimer in elevating plasma cortisol level was estimated to be approximately 6–8 times greater than that of the same pressor dose of synthetic lysine vasopressin monomer (LVP-Monomer). Plasma ACTH activity was also found to rise after LVP-Dimer injection. The maximal rise of plasma ACTH, from undetectable level to about 0.6 mU/100 ml, was observed 5 min after injection, corresponding to the beginning of the rise in plasma cortisol. Side-effects, after LVP-Dimer injection, such as elevation of the blood pressure, urge to defecate, etc., were less than after LVP-Monomer. One mg of dexa...",1968,0,5,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

The field, subjected to repetitive quantum nondemolition photon counting, undergoes jumps between photon number states. We select ensembles of field realizations evolving from a given Fock state and reconstruct the subsequent evolution of their photon number distributions. We realize in this way a tomography of the photon number relaxation process yielding all the jump rates between Fock states. The damping rates of the n photon states (0 < or = n < or = 7) are found to increase linearly with n. The results are in excellent agreement with theory including a small thermal contribution.",2008,6,71,1,2,11,11,6,6,11,6,3,4,2
ce92d0d7acd8e770b81150da065e78af9cfe29ef,Interaction of Grb2 via its Src homology 3 domains with synaptic proteins including synapsin I.,"Grb2 is a 25-kDa adaptor protein composed of a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and two flanking Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. One function of Grb2 is to couple tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (through its SH2 domain) to downstream effectors (through its SH3 domains). Using an overlay assay, we have identified four major Grb2-binding proteins in synaptic fractions. These proteins interact with wild-type Grb2 but not with Grb2 containing point mutations in each of its two SH3 domains corresponding to the loss of function mutants in the Caenorhabditis elegans Grb2 homologue sem-5. Two of the proteins, mSos and dynamin, were previously shown to bind Grb2. The third protein of 145 kDa is brain specific and to our knowledge has not been previously described. The fourth protein is synapsin I. Dynamin is required for synaptic vesicle endocytosis and synapsin I is thought to mediate the interaction of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic cytomatrix. These data suggest that Grb2, or other proteins containing SH3 domains, may play a role in the regulation of the exo/endocytotic cycle of synaptic vesicles and therefore of neurotransmitter release.",1994,3,141,2,2,7,16,14,13,11,6,9,2,4

Jena Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, MI Co-Founder and President, QPathology, MA Abstract Secretion is a fundamental cellular process in living organisms, from yeast to cells in humans. Since the 1950’s, it was believed that secretory vesicles completely merge with the cell plasma membrane during secretion, resulting in the diffusing out of intravesicular contents. However, the observation of partially empty vesicles in cells following secretion suggested the presence of transient or so called ‘kiss-and-run’ mechanism that allows fractional discharge of intra-vesicular contents during secretion. This proposed mechanism is mediated by a nanoscale supramolecular cup-shaped lipoprotein structure at the cell plasma membrane called porosome. Porosomes range in size from 15 nm in neurons and astrocytes, to 180 nm in endocrine and exocrine cells. Neuronal porosomes are composed of nearly 40 proteins compared to the 120 nm nuclear pore composed of nearly 1,000 protein molecules. Porosome structure, its chemical composition, and functional reconstitution into artificial lipid membrane and in live cells, and the molecular assembly of membrane-associated t-SNARE and v-SNARE proteins in a ring or rosette complex to establish the fusion pore at the porosome base, and the molecular mechanism of secretory vesicle volume increase required for intravesicular content expulsion with great precision, collectively provide a molecular understanding of cell secretion, resulting in a paradigm-shift in our understanding of the process.

Development of Nanocomposites for Energy Storage and Photocatalysis Jae-Jin Shim*, Amr Hussein Mady, Debananda Mohapatra, Marjorie Baynosa and Ganesh Dhakal Yeungnam University, South Korea Abstract Due to the increase in the use of renewable energy which has unsteady supply, energy storage has been an important issue worldwide. In addition, due to the increase in the environmental pollution, decomposition technique and efficient catalysts are required to solve the problems. Materials based on carbon materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon fibers have been studied for capacitive energy storage purposes. On the other hand, materials based on metal oxides or sulfides have been studied as catalysts and photocatalysts. Because their performances are limited, many attempts have been made to enhance their electrochemical properties by combining carbon materials with metal oxides or sulfides for both supercapacitors and catalysts applications. Due to their large surface area and high electrical conductivity, synergistic effects of excellent conductivities of graphene and high electrochemical properties of metal oxides or sulfides have improved the overall electrochemical performances tremendously. These composites show good electrochemical performances especially they are reduced to nano-size. In this study, carbonaceous materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon nano-onions and various mono-, binary-, and ternary-metal oxides or sulfides have been combined to make nanocomposites. Doping of sulfur or nitrogen has also been investigated to get higher performances.

Liver cell destruction by H-2 class I- restricted virus-specific cytotoxic T cells as a physiological correlate of the 51Cr-release assay?,"A model for immunologically T cell-mediated hepatitis was established in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The severity of hepatitis was monitored histologically and by determination of changes in serum levels of the enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), and alkaline phosphatase (AP). Kinetics of histological disease manifestations, increases of liver enzyme levels in the serum, and cytotoxic T cell activities in livers and spleens all correlated and were dependent upon several parameters: LCMV-isolate; LCMV-WE caused extensive hepatitis, LCMV-Armstrong virtually none. Virus dose. Route of infection; i.v. or i.p. infection caused hepatitis, whereas infection into the footpad did not. The general genetic background of the murine host; of the strains tested, Swiss mice and A-strain mice were more susceptible than C57BL or CBA mice; BALB/c and DBA/2 mice were least susceptible. The degree of immunocompetence of the murine host; T cell deficient nu/nu mice never developed hepatitis, whereas nu/+ or +/+ mice always did. B cell-depleted anti-IgM-treated mice developed immune-mediated hepatitis comparably or even more extensively than control mice. Local cytotoxic T cell activity; mononuclear cells isolated from livers during the period of overt hepatitis were two to five times more active than equal numbers of spleen cells. Adoptive transfer of nylon wool-nonadherent anti-Thy-1.2 and anti-Lyt-2 plus C- sensitive, anti-L3T4 plus C-resistant lymphocytes into irradiated mice preinfected with LCMV-WE caused a rapid time- and dose-dependent linear increase of serum enzyme levels. This increase was caused by adoptive transfer of lymphocytes if immune cell donors and recipient mice shared class I, but not when they shared class II histocompatibility antigens. The donor cell dose-dependent increase of these enzymes was first measurable 6-18 h after transfer with 2 X 10(8) cells or 3 X 10(6) cells, respectively. The time-dependent increase caused by the adoptive transfer of 1-2 X 10(8) cells was strictly linear during a period of up to 25-40 h. These results indicate single-hit kinetics of liver cell death and suggest that effector T cells destroy infected liver cells via direct contact rather than via soluble toxic mediators. The results may represent the best in vivo correlate of the in vitro 51Cr-release assay that has been analyzed so far, and strongly support the view that antiviral cytotoxic T cells are directly cytolytic in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1986,50,194,6,0,2,4,7,2,3,3,6,4,8

The equilibrium configuration depends on the interaction energies between the adsorbed particles which can be estimated in simple cases from LEED observations. The transition from a random to an ordered configuration by means of surface diffusion can be computer simulated using the Monte Carlo method. The corresponding positions of “extra” spots in the LEED pattern are calculated. The method has been applied to the system Pd(110) + O 2 . In particular it is shown that the observed continuous splitting of diffraction spots is a consequence of the statistical behavior of the system.,1970,17,107,0,0,6,3,6,1,4,3,5,7,3

This report shows that both TRH and AP reduce dose-dependently the food intake during sham-feeding and inhibit gastric and pancreatic secretions in response to various exogenous and endogenous stimulants in conscious dogs. The results indicate that TRH and AP have similar inhibitory action on feeding and gastrointestinal secretory activity and that they may be involved in peptidergic mediation of satiety and gastrointestinal secretion.",1981,16,14,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,0,0,0,0

Latent period,"The latent period of the flexor reflex was first measured as the interval between the application of a stimulus and the beginning of the mechanical response of the muscle (Sherrington, 1906). Jolly (1911) introduced the electrical response of the muscle recorded by the string galvanometer as a basis of measurement of latent period, and he calculated that the time occupied in the passage through the spinal cord (central reflex-time) was about 4σ. Forbes and Gregg (1915) used the electrical response of the motor nerve in their measurements of latent period and calculated that the central reflextime was 3 to 5σ, thus confirming Jolly. In both calculations, however, certain assumptions had to be made as to the velocity of propagation of impluses in the afferent nerve fibres. Since 1915 there has been no systematic investigation of the latent period of the flexor reflex. In the following investigation an attempt has been made to throw fresh light on the nature and duration of its latent period.",1931,4,37,0,3,1,1,3,3,3,2,1,1,0

Here, the structure of cytochrome c(552) from P. denitrificans with the linker segment that attaches the globular domain to the membrane anchor is presented. Cytochrome c(552) including the linker segment was crystallized and its structure was determined by molecular replacement. The structural features provide functionally important information. The prediction of the flexibility of the linker region [Berry & Trumpower (1985), J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2458-2467] was confirmed by our crystal structure. The N-terminal region from residues 13 to 31 is characterized by poor electron density, which is compatible with high mobility of this region. This result indicates that this region is highly flexible, which is functionally important for this protein to shuttle electrons between complexes III and IV in the respiratory chain. Zinc present in the crystallization buffer played a key role in the successful crystallization of this protein.

The correlation observed between the sensitivity of H. marismortui to anisomycin and the affinity of its large ribosomal subunits for the drug indicates that its response to anisomycin is determined primarily by the binding of the drug to its large ribosomal subunit. The structures of large ribosomal subunits containing resistance mutations show that these mutations can be divided into two classes: (1) those that interfere with specific drug-ribosome interactions and (2) those that stabilize the apo conformation of the A-site cleft of the ribosome relative to its drug-bound conformation. The conformational effects of some mutations of the second kind propagate through the ribosome for considerable distances and are reversed when A-site substrates bind to the ribosome.",2008,33,81,7,2,13,12,11,7,6,5,8,6,2

By hybridization with different HPV DNA probes under non‐stringent conditions (Tm −40° C), two tumors were found to contain HPV‐specific DNA sequences in high copy numbers: (1) a keratoacanthoma from a patient who also suffered from a basalioma; (2) a superficial spreading malignant melanoma of an immunosuppressed patient. For further analysis of these DNA sequences genomic libraries from both tumour DNAs were constructed and, out of these, 4 different HPV DNA types have been cloned. By cross‐hybridization experiments and restriction map analysis HPV 9 DNA was identified in the keratoacanthoma whereas HPV 17a DNA could be cloned from the malignant melanoma. From each tumor one additional HPV‐type not identical to other known HPV‐types was cloned. These isolates are closely related to HPV 9, 15, 17, 22 and 23. A physical map of both HPV DNAs was constructed. Size (7.8 kbp), co‐linear alignment to HPV 16, cross‐hybridization with other HPV‐types under conditions of low stringency and monomic episomal state of the HPV molecules indicate that these two DNA probes represent new HPV types that have been tentatively designated as HPV 37 (keratoacanthoma) and HPV 38 (malignant melanoma).

This inhibition was reversed by increased ribosomes plus poly U in the incubation mixture but not by increased aminoacyl-sRNA or supernatant fraction. In contrast to the lack of effect of puromycin and chloramphenicol, tetracycline reduced the binding of N-acetyl-phenylalanyl-sRNA to ribosomes, whereas the binding of poly U to ribosomes was unaffected. Although polyphenylalanine synthesis was inhibited almost completely by tetracycline, aminoacyl-sRNA binding to ribosomes was inhibited maximally about 50 per cent. We suggest that tetracycline may combine with ribosomes in such a way as to obstruct one of the two sites for the binding of aminoacyl-sRNA.",1965,5,151,0,5,10,20,10,16,8,11,7,6,5

11e65ee47b60fd1119bfe7b6f72e054d3bef4e70,Fluctuations in the microsecond time range of the current through single acetylcholine receptor ion channels,"Acetylcholine-like drugs cause ion channels in the skeletal muscle endplate to open briefly1, producing, at random intervals, rectangular pulses of current with constant amplitude but random duration, that can be recorded by the patch clamp method2,3. However, even when the agonist concentration is so low that channel activations are very well separated, we have observed, with high resolution methods4, that openings may be interrupted by shut periods (gaps) so brief that they are very unlikely to arise from two independent channel activations. This sort of behaviour has been predicted on the basis that two or more openings might occur during the time for which the receptor remains occupied by agonist5,6. If this were correct, important new information about agonist activation of ion channels could be obtained from measurements of the gaps between openings. However, short gaps could arise in other ways: for example from brief blockage of the ion channel7, perhaps by the agonist itself. We now present results obtained with the acetylcholine-like agonist, suberyldicholine (SubCh, 20–100 nM), which suggest that the brief gaps do not result from ion channel block by the agonist itself, but which are consistent with a mechanism in which the channel opens and closes several times during a single agonist receptor occupancy. We have also observed that the number of short (<1 ms) current pulses is greater than we expected.",1981,8,332,7,1,11,41,31,23,30,15,19,9,10

These paralogous genes have retained functional redundancy during evolution. For this reason, loss of only one or two Hox genes within a paralogous group often results in incompletely penetrant phenotypes which are difficult to interpret by molecular analysis. For example, mice individually mutant for Hoxa11 or Hoxd11 show no discernible kidney abnormalities. Hoxa11/Hoxd11 double mutants, however, demonstrate hypoplasia of the kidneys. As described in this study, removal of the last Hox11 paralogous member, Hoxc11, results in the complete loss of metanephric kidney induction. In these triple mutants, the metanephric blastema condenses, and expression of early patterning genes, Pax2 and Wt1, is unperturbed. Eya1 expression is also intact. Six2 expression, however, is absent, as is expression of the inducing growth factor, Gdnf. In the absence of Gdnf, ureteric bud formation is not initiated. Molecular analysis of this phenotype demonstrates that Hox11 control of early metanephric induction is accomplished by the interaction of Hox11 genes with the pax-eya-six regulatory cascade, a pathway that may be used by Hox genes more generally for the induction of multiple structures along the anteroposterior axis.",2002,51,256,19,1,12,11,10,8,15,17,15,11,12

The blocked RNAPII targets these transcription-blocking adducts to undergo more rapid excision repair than adducts located elsewhere in the genome. In excision repair, coupled incisions are made in the damaged DNA strand on both sides of the adduct. The fate of RNAPII in the course of this transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway is unclear. To address the fate of RNAPII, we used methods that control transcription to initiate a discrete “wave” of elongation complexes. Analyzing genome-wide transcription and repair by next-generation sequencing, we identified locations of elongation complexes and transcription-repair coupling events in genes throughout the genome. Using UV-exposed human skin fibroblasts, we found that, at the dose used, a single wave of elongation complexes was blocked within the first 25 kb of genes. TCR occurred where the elongation complexes were blocked, and repair was associated with the dissociation of these complexes. These results indicate that individual elongation complexes do not engage in multiple rounds of TCR with successive lesions. Our results are consistent with a model in which RNAPII is dissociated after the dual incision of the transcription-blocking lesion, perhaps by Cockayne syndrome group B translocase, or during the synthesis of a repair patch.",2017,42,29,0,0,8,10,8,3,0,0,0,0,0

Recently, combinations of different therapeutic strategies (based on mechanisms of apoptosis, differentiation and cytotoxicity) have significantly increased survival. To further improve outcome, we studied the potential efficacy of boosting the patient's immune response using specific immunotherapy. In an animal model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, we developed a DNA-based vaccine by fusing the human promyelocytic leukemia–retinoic acid receptor-α (PML-RARA) oncogene to tetanus fragment C (FrC) sequences. We show for the first time that a DNA vaccine specifically targeted to an oncoprotein can have a pronounced effect on survival, both alone and when combined with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The survival advantage is concomitant with time-dependent antibody production and an increase in interferon-γ (IFN-γ). We also show that ATRA therapy on its own triggers an immune response in this model. When DNA vaccination and conventional ATRA therapy are combined, they induce protective immune responses against leukemia progression in mice and may provide a new approach to improve clinical outcome in human leukemia.",2003,32,73,1,2,9,9,3,7,4,4,3,3,2

Two of these proteins, termed reductase promoter factor (RPF) proteins A and B, bind to the promoter for hamster 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, a negatively regulated enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. In the current study, we determined the sequences of peptides derived from hamster RPF proteins A and B and used this information to isolate a cDNA, designated pNF1/Red1, that encodes RPF protein B. The peptide sequence of RPF protein A, the other reductase-related protein, suggests that it is the hamster equivalent of NF1/L, which was previously cloned from rat liver. We also isolated a hamster cDNA for an additional member of the NF1 family, designated NF1/X. Thus, the hamster genome contains at least three genes for NF1-like proteins. It is likely to contain a fourth gene, corresponding to NF1/CTF, which was previously cloned from the human. The NH2-terminal sequences of all four NF1-like proteins (NF1/Red1, NF1/L, NF1/X, and NF1/CTF), which are virtually identical, contain the DNA-binding domain that recognizes TGG. Functional diversity may arise from differences in the COOH-terminal sequences. We hypothesize that the COOH-terminal domain interacts with adjacent DNA-binding proteins, thereby stabilizing the binding of a particular NF1-like protein to a particular promoter. This protein-protein interaction confers specificity to a class of proteins whose DNA-recognition sequence is widespread in the genome. Sterols may repress transcription of the reductase gene by disrupting this protein-protein interaction.",1988,0,129,9,0,8,9,10,12,12,5,7,13,10

f9f3ade0c68dfd07e88c6ac6e23aaca23f8c1704,Disassembly of mitotic checkpoint complexes by the joint action of the AAA-ATPase TRIP13 and p31comet,"Significance The mitotic checkpoint system has an important role to ensure accurate segregation of chromosomes in mitosis. This system regulates the activity of the ubiquitin ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) by the formation of a negatively acting Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC). When the checkpoint is satisfied, MCC is disassembled, but the mechanisms of MCC disassembly are not well understood. We show here that the ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme Thyroid Receptor Interacting Protein 13 (TRIP13), along with the MCC-targeting protein p31comet, promote the disassembly of the mitotic checkpoint complexes and the inactivation of the mitotic checkpoint. The results reveal an important molecular mechanism in the regulation of APC/C by the mitotic checkpoint. The mitotic (or spindle assembly) checkpoint system delays anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle. When the checkpoint is active, a Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC) assembles and inhibits the ubiquitin ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). MCC is composed of the checkpoint proteins Mad2, BubR1, and Bub3 associated with the APC/C activator Cdc20. When the checkpoint signal is turned off, MCC is disassembled and the checkpoint is inactivated. The mechanisms of the disassembly of MCC are not sufficiently understood. We have previously observed that ATP hydrolysis is required for the action of the Mad2-binding protein p31comet to disassemble MCC. We now show that HeLa cell extracts contain a factor that promotes ATP- and p31comet-dependent disassembly of a Cdc20–Mad2 subcomplex and identify it as Thyroid Receptor Interacting Protein 13 (TRIP13), an AAA-ATPase known to interact with p31comet. The joint action of TRIP13 and p31comet also promotes the release of Mad2 from MCC, participates in the complete disassembly of MCC and abrogates checkpoint inhibition of APC/C. We propose that TRIP13 plays centrally important roles in the sequence of events leading to MCC disassembly and checkpoint inactivation.",2014,30,95,6,2,15,12,15,13,11,16,10,0,0
868790ec700eaaa215a7037070372ff198850d1e,Studies on the partition of iron in bone marrow cells.,"Canine marrow cells were incubated with transferrin-bound (59)Fe, and the partition of cellular iron was studied by chromatographic and gel filtration methods. Splitting-off of iron from the stromal fraction was avoided by lysing the cells in Tris HCl buffer at pH 8.6. Cellular iron was divided into four major compartments: stroma, microsomes, main hemoglobin, and fraction I. The iron in fraction I was found in ferritin, heme proteins, and low molecular weight iron. With incubation times of 3-10 min, (59)Fe appeared promptly in the main hemoglobin. The entry of (59)Fe into ferritin paralleled that of hemoglobin but was smaller in amount. When the marrow cells were incubated with (59)Fe for 15-20 min and reincubated without radioactive iron, movement of (59)Fe into main hemoglobin was observed, and essentially all this iron came from the particulate fraction (stroma, mitochondria, and microsomes). In these chase experiments there was no change in the total quantity of (59)Fe in ferritin. There was no evidence of a significant hemoglobin precursor other than low molecular weight iron. DEPENDING UPON CONCENTRATION, LEAD WAS OBSERVED TO INHIBIT CELLULAR IRON METABOLISM AT SEVERAL POINTS: uptake of iron by the cell, movement of iron from stroma to the soluble intracellular compartment, and synthesis of hemoglobin. The most pronounced inhibitory effect of lead was always on hemoglobin synthesis with an increase in ferritin: hemoglobin ratio. Bipyridine appeared to trap intracellular ferrous iron and to inhibit synthesis of both hemoglobin and ferritin. It was concluded that iron moves from the stroma into the soluble intracellular compartment as low molecular weight iron, probably as a complex of ferrous iron with low molecular weight components of the cytoplasm, that serves as the source of iron for both hemoglobin and ferritin synthesis.",1968,20,64,0,0,0,2,3,2,6,5,2,1,4

For a set of ancient conserved proteins, with intronless prokaryotic but intron-containing eukaryotic homologs, multiple sequence alignments identified residues invariant throughout evolution. Intron positions between codons show no preferences. However, introns lying after the first base of a codon prefer conserved regions, markedly in glycines. Because glycines are in excess in conserved regions, this behavior could reflect phase-one introns entering glycine residues randomly in the ancestral sequences. Examination of intron positions within codons of evolutionarily invariable amino acids showed that roughly 50% of these introns are bordered by guanines at both 5'- and 3'-ends, 25% have a G only before the intron, and 5% have a G only after the intron, whereas about 20% are bordered by nonguanine bases.",2002,15,18,0,1,1,1,2,1,3,2,0,0,1

Two chemical features are key to the bioactivity of LTB4, namely, the chirality of the 12R-hydroxyl group and the cis-trans-trans geometry of the conjugated triene structure. From the crystal structure of LTA4H, a hydrophilic patch composed of Gln-134, Tyr-267, and Asp-375 was identified in a narrow and otherwise hydrophobic pocket, believed to bind LTA4. In addition, Asp-375 belongs to peptide K21, a previously characterized 21-residue active site-peptide to which LTA4 binds during suicide inactivation. In the present report we used site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography to show that Asp-375, but none of the other candidate residues, is specifically required for the epoxide hydrolase activity of LTA4H. Thus, mutation of Asp-375 leads to a selective loss of the enzyme's ability to generate LTB4 whereas the aminopeptidase activity is preserved. We propose that Asp-375, possibly assisted by Gln-134, acts as a critical determinant for the stereoselective introduction of the 12R-hydroxyl group and thus the biological activity of LTB4.",2002,33,43,0,1,4,6,1,0,2,1,0,2,4

6c15c9d50f90210994cba0ab6cdbb780511121fc,"Studies on polynucleotides, XC. DNA polymerase-catalyzed repair of short DNA duplexes with single-stranded ends.","Short chemically synthesized deoxyribopolynucleotides containing appropriate 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl end groups can be enzymatically joined end to end, when they are properly aligned, to form bihelical complexes.l1 2 In this way, several short DNA's (Fig. 1, DNA-III-DNA-VI) corresponding to a part of the gene for yeast ala-tRNA have been prepared.2 The products (Fig. 1) are not perfect duplexes; the strands at the 3'-hydroxyl termini are shorter by one, a few, or as many as ten nucleotide units. To pursue our interest in the chemistry of DNA repair and to further characterize the above products of DNA-joining enzymes,2 we have studied the incorporation of nucleotides catalyzed by the DNA polymerase of E. coli by using conditions under which repair of singlestranded ends has previously been demonstrated.' At the start of the present work, we were particularly encouraged by the recent results of Wu and Kaiser4 who have successfully used the DNA polymerase for structural analysis of the cohesive ends of XDNA. Our present results with the short DNA's of Figure 1 show that: (1) the DNA polymerase does indeed bring about repair of the strands shorter at the 3'-hydroxyl ends; (2) the repair reaction continues essentially to completion except for the very terminal nucleotide unit; and (3) there is no evidence of any further synthesis, i.e., any nucleotide incorporation beyond that required for the repair reaction. Furthermore, there was no manifestation of any exonucleolytic activity under the conditions used for the repair reactions and, again, this conclusion is in agreement with that of Wu and Kaiser.4 Materials and Methods.-All of the DNA's used in the repair reactions are shown in Figure 1: DNA-Il is simply a mixture of equivalent amounts of the two synthetic icosanucleotides Icosa-I and Icosa-II;2 DNA-I is a mixture of Icosa-I and the complementary heptanucleotide P12-C-T-A-A-G-G-G (Hepta-I) ;2 DNA-III-DNA-VI all originated from the DNA ligase-catalyzed joining of short complementary oligonucleotides to one or both of the icosanucleotides of DNA-Il, as described previously.2 Thus, DNA-III resulted from Icosa-I + Icosa-II + the nonanucleotide P12-T-C-T-C-C-G-G-T-T (NonaII); DNA-IV resulted from the two icosanucleotides + Hepta-I (see above) and Hepta-II (P32-T-C-T-C-C-G-G); DNA-V resulted from the two icosanucleotides + Hepta-I + Nona-II, and DNA-VI resulted from the two icosanucleotides + Nona-I (P'2-C-T-A-A G-G-G-A-G) + Hepta-Il. The joining reactions used 5'-P12-labeled (weakly) heptaand nonanucleotides and were carried out with the T4-induced ligase as described before,2 except that the shorter components (heptaand nonaiiucleotides) were used ill amounts somewhat in excess (25-75%) of those estimated to be stoichiometric with the icosanueleotides. In some experiments, the ligase products were freed from the excess of the short oligonucleotides by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column; very often, however, the incubation mixtures after the joining reactions served directly as stock solutions for the repair reactions. In the latter case, the gel filtration method used for isolation of the DNA-polymerase products separated the DNA's both from the excess of the 5'-P'2-oligonucleotides and the excess of the deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates.",1968,0,7,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

This result supports the conjecture that solvation stabilizes the β anomer in water. There is a large difference in the intramolecular contribution to the anomeric equilibrium calculated in solution from the free energy simulation and the gas-phase minimum; this suggests that conformational averaging, modulated by the solvent, is significant even for the internal terms.

Questioning this assumption on the basis of previous split-brain and hemispherectomy observations, we applied lateralized tests for left hemineglect in three subjects with complete forebrain commissurotomy. Results for the left disconnected hemisphere revealed substantial awareness for the left side of the body and also for extrapersonal space, far greater than suggested by the unilateral lesion data. It is inferred that the left hemisphere, functioning independently, possesses the requisite cognitive mechanisms needed to prevent the appearance of the typical neglect syndrome as observed following right-sided lesions.

be66b901aed8eb322659ce9be02f76c651ae7146,Donor-acceptor ring-in-ring complexes.,"The self-assembly of three donor-acceptor ring-in-ring complexes, prepared from the π-electron-deficient tetracationic cyclophane, cyclobis(paraquat-4,4'-biphenylene), and three large π-electron-rich crown ethers (each 50-membered rings) containing dioxynaphthalene (DNP) and tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) units in pairs (DNP/DNP, DNP/TTF and TTF/TTF), is reported. (1)H NMR spectroscopic analyses are indicative of the formation of 1:1 complexes in CD(3)CN, whilst the charge-transfer interactions between the DNP and TTF units of the crown ethers and the tetracationic cyclophane have permitted the measurement of binding constants of up to 4×10(3) M(-1) in CH(3)CN to be made using UV/Vis spectroscopy. Ring-in-ring complexes are proposed as intermediates in the stepwise synthesis of molecular Borromean rings (BRs) comprised of three different rings. With the particular choice of crown ethers, the 1:1 complexes have polyether loops that protrude from the donor-acceptor recognition point above and below the mean plane of the tetracationic cyclophane, which, ideally, could conceivably bind dialkylammonium centers present in a third ring. X-ray crystallographic analyses of the solid-state superstructures of two of the three 1:1 complexes reveal, however, the presence of prodigious CH···O interactions between the polyether loops of the crown ethers and the rims of the cyclophane, no doubt stabilizing the complexes, but, at the same time, masking their potential recognition sites from further interactions that are essential to the subsequent emergence of the third ring. The solid-state superstructure of one of the crown ethers binding two dibenzylammonium ions provides some insight into the design requirements for the next generation of these systems; longer polyether loops may be required to allow optimal interactions between all components. It has become clear during a pursuit of the stepwise synthesis of the molecular BRs that, when designing complex mechanically interlocked molecules utilizing multiple recognition sites, the unsullied orthogonality of the recognition motifs is of the utmost importance.",2012,148,30,0,3,4,4,4,5,2,2,4,2,0

dc0854868d44fd52b8fb890cd048b131e3c95d13,Amphiphilic Bistable Rotaxanes,"Two molecular shuttles/ switches-a slow one and a fast one- in the shape of amphiphilic, bistable [2]rotaxanes have been synthesized and characterized. Both [2]rotaxanes contain a hydrophobic, tetraarylmethane and a hydrophilic, dendritic stopper. They are comprised of two π-electron-rich stations-a monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene unit and a 1,5-dioxynaphthalene moiety-which can act as recognition sites for the tetracationic cyclophane, cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene), to reside around. In addition, a model [2]rotaxane, incorporating only a monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene unit in the rod section of the amphiphilic dumbbell component and cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) as the ring component, has been investigated. The dumbbell-shaped components were constructed using conventional synthetic methodologies to assemble 1) the hydrophobic, tetraarylmethane stopper and 2) the hydrophilic, dendritic stopper. Next, 3) the hydrophobic stopper was fused to the 1,5-dioxynaphthalene moiety and/or the monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene unit by appropriate alkylations, followed by 4) attachment of the hydrophilic stopper, once again by alkylation to give the dumbbell-shaped compounds. Finally, 5) the [2]rotaxanes were self-assembled by using the dumbbells as templates for the formation of the encircling cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetracations. The two [2]rotaxanes differ in their arrangement of the π-electron-rich units, one in which the SMe group of the monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene unit points toward the 1,5-dioxynaphthalene moiety (2 . 4PF 6 ) and another in which it points away from the 1,5-dioxynaphthalene moiety (3 . 4PF 6 ). This seemingly small difference in the orientation of the monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene unit leads to profound changes in the physical properties of these rotaxanes. The bistable [2]rotaxanes were both isolated as brown solids. 1 H NMR and UV-visible spectroscopy, and electrochemical investigations, reveal the presence of both possible translational isomers at ambient temperature. As a consequence of the existence of both possible translational isomers in these bistable [2]rotaxanes, they exhibit a complex electrochemical behavior, which is further complicated by the presence of folded conformations wherein the monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene unit is involved in an ""alongside"" interaction with the tetracationic cyclophane. In the molecular shuttle/switch 2 . 4PF 6 a ""knob"", in the shape of the SMe group, is situated between the monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene and the 1,5-dioxynaphthalene recognition sites, making it possible to isolate both translational isomers (2 . 4 PF 6 . GREEN and 2 . 4 PF 6 . RED) and to investigate the kinetics of the shuttling of the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetracation between the two recognition sites. The shuttling processes, which are accompanied by clearly detectable color changes, can be followed by 'H NMR and UV-visible spectroscopy, allowing the rate constants and energies of activation for the translation of the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetracations between the two recognition sites to be determined. In the molecular shuttle/switch 3 . 4PF 6 , there is no ""knob"" situated between the 1,5-dioxynaphthalene and the monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene recognition sites, resulting in a considerably faster shuttling of the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetracation between these two sites, making the separation of the two possible translational isomers of 3 . 4PF 6 impractical. However, the shuttling of the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetracation can be followed by dynamic 1 H NMR spectroscopy. At low temperatures, the major translational isomer is 3 . 4 PF 6 . RED, while 3 . 4 PF 6 . GREEN is the major isomer at higher temperature. In the bistable [2]rotaxanes shuttling of the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetracations can be driven by electrochemical oxidation of the monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene unit.

This motif is conserved among precursors that are cleaved in virtually all mammalian cell types.

Decreased vascular NO has been linked to abdominal obesity, smoking and high intakes of fat and sugar, which all cause oxidative stress. Men with ED have decreased vascular NO and circulating and cellular antioxidants. Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers are increased in men with ED, and all increase with age. Exercise increases vascular NO, and more frequent erections are correlated with decreased ED, both in part due to stimulation of endothelial NO production by shear stress. Exercise and weight loss increase insulin sensitivity and endothelial NO production. Potent antioxidants or high doses of weaker antioxidants increase vascular NO and improve vascular and erectile function. Antioxidants may be particularly important in men with ED who smoke, are obese or have diabetes. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammatory markers, decrease cardiac death and increase endothelial NO production, and are therefore critical for men with ED who are under age 60 years, and/or have diabetes, hypertension or coronary artery disease, who are at increased risk of serious or even fatal cardiac events. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors have recently been shown to improve antioxidant status and NO production and allow more frequent and sustained penile exercise. Some angiotensin II receptor blockers decrease oxidative stress and improve vascular and erectile function and are therefore preferred choices for lowering blood pressure in men with ED. Lifestyle modifications, including physical and penile-specific exercise, weight loss, omega-3 and folic acid supplements, reduced intakes of fat and sugar, and improved antioxidant status through diet and/or supplements should be integrated into any comprehensive approach to maximizing erectile function, resulting in greater overall success and patient satisfaction, as well as improved vascular health and longevity.",2012,80,49,2,1,5,10,5,6,7,2,2,3,7

The set of physiological pathways in common among these life span extending interventions provides an initial step toward defining molecular genetic and physiological changes important in life span extension.

Through optical pumping, the atom can be made to feel decelerating optical dipole forces more strongly than accelerating optical dipole forces. This effect, which has previously been realized for free atoms, is called Sisyphus cooling. A simple model for a bound atom is examined in order to reveal the basic aspects of cooling and heating when the atom is confined in the Lamb–Dicke regime. Results of semiclassical and quantum treatments show that the minimum energy achieved is near the zero-point energy and can be much lower than the Doppler cooling limit. Two practical examples that approximate the model are briefly examined.",1992,15,47,2,1,4,0,2,1,0,0,0,2,1
632704a2614476844a350fcb6602101ed1daa648,Exponential form of joint probability distribution; unequal atoms,"The joint probability distributions for three structure factors whose subscripts add to zero, in the general case of unequal atoms, are expressed in an exponential form for space groups P1 and P{\bar 1}. The latter are representative of noncentrosymmetric and centrosymmetric space groups respectively. The exponential form possesses considerably improved convergence properties over those of the standard asymptotic series, although it too remains asymptotic. With the range of values ordinarily obtained for the normalized structure-factor magnitudes, the exponential forms are quite accurate. However, the accuracy deteriorates somewhat as these magnitudes approach their largest possible values. By altering the exponential form with the use of a result from the inequality theory, joint probability distributions are obtained which are accurate over the entire range of values for the structure-factor magnitudes and are most accurate at the largest values. Several probability measures of interest are derived from the joint distribution functions such as expected values, variances and the probability that a structure factor has a positive sign. Numerical tests indicate that the derived probability measures are very reliable and that their validity extends to higher space groups than P1 and P{\bar 1}.",1973,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, it has been demonstrated that some GPCRs activate G proteins from within internalized cellular compartments, resulting in sustained signaling. We have used a variety of biochemical, biophysical, and cell-based methods to demonstrate the existence, functionality, and architecture of internalized receptor complexes composed of a single GPCR, β-arrestin, and G protein. These super-complexes or ""megaplexes"" more readily form at receptors that interact strongly with β-arrestins via a C-terminal tail containing clusters of serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. Single-particle electron microscopy analysis of negative-stained purified megaplexes reveals that a single receptor simultaneously binds through its core region with G protein and through its phosphorylated C-terminal tail with β-arrestin. The formation of such megaplexes provides a potential physical basis for the newly appreciated sustained G protein signaling from internalized GPCRs.",2016,40,326,14,10,70,72,59,72,43,0,0,0,0

Contrary to these assumptions, we have identified hyperthermostable variants of Bacillus licheniformis α-amylase (BLA) that result from the incorporation of hydrophobic residues at the surface. Under highly destabilizing conditions, a variant combining five stabilizing mutations unfolds 32 times more slowly and at a temperature 13 °C higher than the wild-type. Crystal structure analysis at 1.7 Å resolution suggests that stabilization is achieved through (a) extension of the concept of increased hydrophobic packing, usually applied to cavities, to surface indentations, (b) introduction of favorable aromatic-aromatic interactions on the surface, (c) specific stabilization of intrinsic metal binding sites, and (d) stabilization of a β-sheet by introducing a residue with high β-sheet forming propensity. All mutated residues are involved in forming complex, cooperative interaction networks that extend from the interior of the protein to its surface and which may therefore constitute “weak points” where BLA unfolding is initiated. This might explain the unexpectedly large effect induced by some of the substitutions on the kinetic stability of BLA. Our study shows that substantial protein stabilization can be achieved by stabilizing surface positions that participate in underlying cooperatively formed substructures. At such positions, even the apparently thermodynamically unfavorable introduction of hydrophobic residues should be explored.",2003,55,121,4,1,10,9,4,6,8,5,11,6,7
463bfdaaeb20506188bc9ffd82565a9d509d927f,Molecular Insights into Mammalian End-binding Protein Heterodimerization*,"Microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) are involved in many microtubule-based processes. End binding (EB) proteins constitute a highly conserved family of +TIPs. They play a pivotal role in regulating microtubule dynamics and in the recruitment of diverse +TIPs to growing microtubule plus ends. Here we used a combination of methods to investigate the dimerization properties of the three human EB proteins EB1, EB2, and EB3. Based on Förster resonance energy transfer, we demonstrate that the C-terminal dimerization domains of EBs (EBc) can readily exchange their chains in solution. We further document that EB1c and EB3c preferentially form heterodimers, whereas EB2c does not participate significantly in the formation of heterotypic complexes. Measurements of the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, homology modeling, and mutagenesis provide details of the molecular determinants of homo- versus heterodimer formation of EBc domains. Fluorescence spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance studies in the presence of the cytoskeleton-associated protein-glycine-rich domains of either CLIP-170 or p150glued or of a fragment derived from the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein show that chain exchange of EBc domains can be controlled by binding partners. Extension of these studies of the EBc domains to full-length EBs demonstrate that heterodimer formation between EB1 and EB3, but not between EB2 and the other two EBs, occurs both in vitro and in cells as revealed by live cell imaging. Together, our data provide molecular insights for rationalizing the dominant negative control by C-terminal EB domains and form a basis for understanding the functional role of heterotypic chain exchange by EBs in cells.",2009,50,50,2,0,2,3,7,6,3,3,3,13,3
dbfabf01fe9b169e32ab5992300dc7f11fc091fd,THE PHARMACOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION OF ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS *,"For over half a century pharmacologists have relied on operational procedures to provide evidence for the existence of adrenergic receptors and for differentiating types of such receptors (for earlier reviews see Furchgott, 1959, 1960a). The procedures used for differentiating types of adrenergic receptors are of two kinds. In the first procedure, dose-response curves of a given effector system are obtained for epinephrine, norepinephrine, and certain closely related amines; and the relative potencies of these agonists are compared. I n the second procedure, the ability of various drugs to antagonize or block the response of the effector system to one or more of the agonists is determined. Ahlquist (1948) first combined results of the two procedures to classify operationally different types of adrenergic receptors. He concluded tha t most adrenergic receptors were of either one or two types which, for convenience, he termed alpha and beta. According to Ahlquist (1948, 1958), the alpha receptors mediate responses for which the order of potency for four of the most commonly used sympathomimetic amines is epinphrine (E) > norepinephrine (NE) > phenylephrine (PE) > isoproterenol (ISO), while beta receptors mediate responses for which the order of potency is IS0 > E > N E > PE. (Actually, Ahlquist used a-methylepinephrine and a-methylnorepinephrine in his original series and not PE, but many investigators now use PE along with E , NE, and ISO.) In addition the responses mediated through alpha receptors can be antagonized by a variety of natural and synthetic agents (including certain ergot alkaloids, phentolamine, and certain p-haloalkylamines, to name but a few) which exhibit little if any antagonism against responses mediated through beta receptors, while responses mediated through beta receptors can be antagonized rather selectively by a number of other synthetic agents (including dichloroisoproterenol, pronethalol and propranolol, to name but a few, all of which were actually introduced 10 or more years after Ahlquist first proposed his operational classification). The Ahlquist classification has been applied with greatest success to adrenergic receptors of various smooth muscles and heart. I t met the challenge that a third type of adrenergic receptor was responsible for mediating inhibition of intestinal smooth muscle (Furchgott, 1959), when Ahlquist & Levy (1959), and later Furchgott (1960a), provided experimental evidence tha t the intestine contained both alpha and beta type receptors, both of which could",1967,22,359,4,2,10,16,17,19,17,12,11,20,12

For example, use of iPSCs may require special guidance with respect to tumorigenicity, genetic integrity, release assays and sterility/aseptic processes. Confusion will arise if existing guidelines are inappropriately adapted or protocols are inadequately generalized to all cell types7–9. It is important to recognize that producing a clinical-grade, PSC-based therapy involves more than complying with cGMP and CMC manufacturing standards. Additional issues that must be considered include regulations on sourcing of donor tissue, ethical guidelines, intellectual-property law and data sharing. Figure 1 outlines the hurdles that arise at different stages of product development. Many of the issues summarized in Figure 1 remain unresolved. For example, in manufacturing, new reference or control material is needed to generate convincing data on in-process testing, lot-to-lot variability and release assays. Guidelines for tissue collection, ownership and payment for PSC generation are in flux10. Equally important, questions regarding consent for the hundreds of thousands of existing samples that could be used as a source of iPSCs must be addressed. More generally, there are uncertainties in how to extend the regulations and standards of institutional review boards, HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Privacy Act) and OHRP (Office for Human Research Protection) to PSC-based therapies10,11. This new class of therapy may also require new interpretations of ethical guidelines12, patent law13,14 and the unique propertyrights issues that arise for cells that can make gametes15. To the Editor: Generating clinical-grade cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) for use in patients is not simply a matter of complying with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) and chemistry and manufacturing controls (CMCs). A range of other issues demand careful attention, including accessing tissue in an ethical manner and adhering to the varied rules and regulations of specific local and national jurisdictions. The current patchwork of practices represents a major hindrance to progress in regenerative medicine. We propose the establishment of an international body tasked with developing, evaluating and harmonizing the technical, ethical, legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the production of therapies based on PSCs. All PSC-based therapies involve the in vitro conversion of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into differentiated cells that migrate, integrate, survive and function therapeutically in patients1,2. These therapies will be administered by different routes, alone or in combination with biologic or synthetic materials, for a variety of indications, and will require different final-product formulations. Although no PSC-based therapy has yet been approved, at least six or seven groups have commenced or are planning early-stage clinical trials. Unlike somatic cells, PSCs are immortal and have the potential to make any differentiated cell type. These differences have important consequences at all stages of clinical translation, manufacture and commercialization, including requirements for shipping, tracking and identity specifications. Therapies based on somatic cells (including multipotent stem cells or other nonpluripotent cell types) involve collecting cells from a particular donor followed by limited growing, testing, storing and banking of the cells. Manufacture of somatic cell–based therapies involves myriad challenges, including compliance with cGMP and CMC regulations, scale-up and scale-out, and appropriate in-process testing and sterility and potency assays. But therapies based on PSCs bring additional layers of complexity. The cells must undergo extensive expansion and long differentiation procedures to generate appropriate phenotypes while eliminating unwanted phenotypes, including residual pluripotent cells3,4. The use of iPSCs as an autologous product that may be genetically modified raises further issues related to small lot sizes and lack of a master cell bank as in allogeneic therapies. The unique challenges associated with PSC-based therapies are summarized in Table 1. In our view, the manufacturing challenges specific to these therapies mean that existing cGMP and CMC regulations",2014,15,62,0,2,18,13,7,8,6,4,4,0,0

Concentrations of tetrachloroethene, ethane, ethyne, and propane decayed over the 24 day duration of the intensive portion of the field campaign, which began November 18, 1995. This decline was consistent with what is known about seasonal increase of HO and the seasonal decrease in biomass burning. Using a simple empirical model, the best fit to the observations was obtained when the average [HO] was 6.1 ± 0.3 × 105 HO cm-3, and an average [Cl] of 720 ± 100 Cl cm-3. The corresponding exchange times were 14 ± 2 days between the MBL and FT, and 49 +40/-13 days between the MBL in the intensive campaign region and the MBL region to the north (nMBL).

At pH 4.8 gamma/2=0.1 acetate buffer, light scattering yielded a Mr of 17 700 and a virial coefficient of 1.0-10(-4) mol-ml/g2. Above pH 7.0 the protein was found to aggregate to higher mol. wt species. Sedimentation experiments at pH 4.8 yielded s degrees 20,w of 1.27 S at gamma/2=0.1 and 1.46 S at gamma/2=0.35.

b5978e7eaac9dd4e2b380ebca51ff30a08ddf475,Docking in Metal-Organic Frameworks,"MOFs with Guest Rooms Metal organic framework (MOF) solids typically boast large pores in their crystal lattices that can accommodate molecular guests and are useful as compact media for gas storage. However, guest binding has generally relied upon nonspecific interactions with the framework components. Li et al. (p. 855) have now prepared MOFs that incorporate macrocyclic ethers into the structural ligands comprising the framework walls within which certain cationic guests can bind quantitatively and site-specifically, akin to the molecular docking of drug molecules within protein receptors. Guest molecules bind site-specifically in macrocycles incorporated into the ligands of a metal organic framework solid. The use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) so far has largely relied on nonspecific binding interactions to host small molecular guests. We used long organic struts (~2 nanometers) incorporating 34- and 36-membered macrocyclic polyethers as recognition modules in the construction of several crystalline primitive cubic frameworks that engage in specific binding in a way not observed in passive, open reticulated geometries. MOF-1001 is capable of docking paraquat dication (PQT2+) guests within the macrocycles in a stereoelectronically controlled fashion. This act of specific complexation yields quantitatively the corresponding MOF-1001 pseudorotaxanes, as confirmed by x-ray diffraction and by solid- and solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies performed on MOF-1001, its pseudorotaxanes, and their molecular strut precursors. A control experiment involving the attempted inclusion of PQT2+ inside a framework (MOF-177) devoid of polyether struts showed negligible uptake of PQT2+, indicating the importance of the macrocyclic polyether in PQT2+ docking.",2009,41,295,2,3,38,32,40,23,38,25,27,12,11

It is, therefore, of the upmost importance that methods by which outwardly complex chemical systems can be assembled selectively, rapidly, and efficiently, are devised. Towards this goal, a trebly diastereoselective tandem Diels-Alder reaction sequence has been developed. Subsequently, we have demonstrated how this synthetic methodology can be utilized for the synthesis of novel macropolycyclic molecular structures. In each cycloaddition, the stereoelectronic characteristics, that are inherent in part of the rigid bicyclic frameworks of both bisdienophile and bisdiene building blocks, are used to dictate their respective modes of reaction. The outcome of this substrate-directed approach to organic synthesis allows the rapid and highly-controlled assembly of an increasing range of apparently complex molecular structures. The diastereoselectivities that are witnessed in each cycloaddition are rationalized as involving kinetically-controlled transition-state effects. The rationalization is based upon maximal vicinal staggering and the subsequent minimization of torsional strain within the rigid bicyclic framework in the transition state. In this survey, the application of the repetitive Diels-Alder approach for the synthesis of a wide range of macropolycyclic molecular structures is examined. The potential of these compounds as ideal precursors in the preparation of intriguing hydrocarbons is revealed. The pivotal role played by the sequential use of mild and forcing conditions — most notably the use of thermally- and high pressure-promoted Diels-Alder reactions — to produce oligomeric compounds in a predictable and stepwise manner is documented. Throughout these discussions, special attention has been given to the methods employed for the purification and characterization of this new class of unnatural products.",1993,298,20,0,4,1,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,0
4cf936ca291642fecbfd0fc56d5733766fc61c17,Geometrical Representation of the Schrödinger Equation for Solving Maser Problems,"A simple, rigorous geometrical representation for the Schrodinger equation is developed to describe the behavior of an ensemble of two quantum‐level, noninteracting systems which are under the influence of a perturbation. In this case the Schrodinger equation may be written, after a suitable transformation, in the form of the real three‐dimensional vector equation dr/dt=ω×r, where the components of the vector r uniquely determine ψ of a given system and the components of ω represent the perturbation. When magnetic interaction with a spin ½ system is under consideration, ``r'' space reduces to physical space. By analogy the techniques developed for analyzing the magnetic resonance precession model can be adapted for use in any two‐level problems. The quantum‐mechanical behavior of the state of a system under various different conditions is easily visualized by simply observing how r varies under the action of different types of ω.

The plasmid contains pGRB1, a 1.8-kilobase-pair plasmid; a 70-base-pair fragment from ISH11, a recently characterized insertion sequence; and a 1.6-kilobase-pair fragment carrying the bop gene from H. halobium S9. When transformed with this plasmid, a bop- insertion mutant of H. halobium yielded purple (Pum+) colonies. The insertion at the chromosomal bop locus remained intact in transformed cells, indicating that the plasmid bop gene was responsible for the Pum+ phenotype. bR was induced in early stationary phase in both wild-type and transformed cells. The final level of bR in transformed cells was 25-40% of that in wild type. The lower level of expression was presumably due to plasmid instability. Purple membrane purified from transformed strains had absorption and visible CD properties similar to wild type and contained bR in a hexagonal lattice with the same unit-cell dimension as wild type. The structure of bR from wild-type and transformed strains was identical at a resolution of 7.2 A.

ARTS induces apoptosis, at least in part, through binding to and antagonizing IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis proteins). As a result of ARTS binding to IAPs, caspase inhibition is removed and apoptosis can be executed. Here we show that high cellular levels of ARTS protein sensitize cells toward apoptosis. Accordingly, in healthy cells ARTS levels are kept low through constant ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Upon proapoptotic stimuli, the ubiquitination process is inhibited, resulting in increased levels of ARTS. Increased ARTS in turn leads to a decrease of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels, cytochrome c release from mitochondria and apoptosis.",2005,0,34,0,0,1,7,3,3,0,5,6,0,1

We have evaluated the inhibitory activity of these molecules in an in vitro assay using prothoracic glands of larvae of Locusta , which normally synthesize large amounts of ecdysone. Two out of twelve compounds which were tested showed a marked depressory effect (up to 60% at 10 −4 M ) which was dose dependent. This effect was irreversible.

It is about 45 Å thick3 and contains a single polypeptide chain comprising about 240 amino acids4. Retinal is covalently attached to a specific lysine residue4 and has been implicated in the absorption of incident light energy2. The retinal lies at an angle of about 20° to the plane of the bilayer5. Seven protein rods running through the membrane, probably α-helices, have been detected by electron diffraction6,7. Circular dichroism studies indicate a 75% helical content which is consistent with a seven-helix model8. A structure containing seven such α-helices requires about 210 amino acids to cross a membrane 45 Å thick seven times, thus implying that most of the polypeptide chain is buried in the lipid bilayer.

superimposed upon its synaptic connectivity map. Neuromodulation changes how neural circuits process information in different states, such as hunger or arousal. Here we describe a genetically based method to map, in an unbiased and brain-wide manner, sites of neuromodulation under different conditions in the Drosophila brain. This method, and genetic perturbations, reveal that the well-known effect of hunger to enhance behavioral sensitivity to sugar is mediated, at least in part, by the 
release of dopamine onto primary gustatory sensory neurons, which enhances sugar-evoked calcium influx. These data reinforce the concept that sensory neurons constitute an important locus for state-dependent gain control of behavior and introduce a methodology that can be extended to other neuromodulators and model organisms.",2012,91,180,12,10,14,31,20,11,29,26,15,16,8

For the Cl atom addition reaction, we find that the only observed isomer of the chloropropyl radical is the 2-chloropropyl and not the 1-chloropropyl radical, indicating that the addition of the Cl atom to the carbon−carbon double bond of propene occurs primarily at the central carbon atom. This is in sharp contrast to the generally accepted mechanism in organic chemistry and in gas-phase reactions in which the addition to the terminal carbon atom is greatly favored. This unique selectivity is possibly due to steric effects in solid para-hydrogen, in which the complex of Cl2 and propene are positioned so that the reacting Cl atom is closer to the central versus the terminal carbon atom of propene. One might be able to make use of this unique property to perform selective chemistry.",2010,34,21,0,0,3,4,4,3,1,1,1,2,1

6231d527b53cbca7d2e5d3ded715ba6824222e82,Enhanced visibility of hydrogen atoms by neutron crystallography on fully deuterated myoglobin.,"Although hydrogens comprise half of the atoms in a protein molecule and are of great importance chemically and structurally, direct visualization of them by using crystallography is difficult. Neutron crystallography is capable of directly revealing the position of hydrogens, but its use on unlabeled samples faces certain technical difficulties: the large incoherent scattering of hydrogen results in background scattering that greatly reduces the signal to noise of the experiment. Moreover, whereas the scattering lengths of C, N, and O are positive, that of hydrogen is negative and about half the magnitude. This results in density for hydrogens being half as strong and close to the threshold of detection at 2.0-A resolution. Also, because of its opposite sign, there is a partial cancellation of the hydrogen density with that from neighboring atoms, which can lead to ambiguities in interpretation at medium resolution. These difficulties can be overcome by the use of deuterated protein, and we present here a neutron structure of fully deuterated myoglobin. The structure reveals a wealth of chemical information about the molecule, including the geometry of hydrogen bonding, states of protonation of histidines, and the location and geometry of water molecules at the surface of the protein. The structure also should be of broader interest because it will serve as a benchmark for molecular dynamics and energy minimization calculations and for comparison with NMR studies.",2000,45,98,3,0,2,2,3,2,1,9,2,7,6

By employing macrocyclic hydroquinone-based polyether templates, (2)catenanes and (3)catenanes, in which the bipyridinium-based cyclophane is mechanically-interlocked with the macrocyclic template(s), can be self-assembled in solution. The introduction of ester functions within these polyether chains of the macrocyclic templates provides the possibility of degrading the catenated structure via ester hydrolysis, thus, releasing the tetracationic cyclophane originally trapped within the catenane. The use of ferrocene-based templates provides a more efficient way to synthesise the bipyridinium-based cyclophane incorporating bitolyl spacers. In particular, the use of a 1,l'disubstituted polyether ferrocene derivative provides the possibility of obtaining the tetracationic cyclophane, cyclobis(paraquat-4,4'- biphenylene) - accessible only in very low yields, without the use of a template - on a preparative scale.",1996,2,48,0,2,3,5,6,3,2,1,1,3,1
395de151b065abf4af6c0d102eb9f06393a4598c,Structural insight into the role of the ribosomal tunnel in cellular regulation,"Nascent proteins emerge out of ribosomes through an exit tunnel, which was assumed to be a firmly built passive path. Recent biochemical results, however, indicate that the tunnel plays an active role in sequence-specific gating of nascent chains and in responding to cellular signals. Consistently, modulation of the tunnel shape, caused by the binding of the semi-synthetic macrolide troleandomycin to the large ribosomal subunit from Deinococcus radiodurans, was revealed crystallographically. The results provide insights into the tunnel dynamics at high resolution. Here we show that, in addition to the typical steric blockage of the ribosomal tunnel by macrolides, troleandomycin induces a conformational rearrangement in a wall constituent, protein L22, flipping the tip of its highly conserved β-hairpin across the tunnel. On the basis of mutations that alleviate elongation arrest, the tunnel motion could be correlated with sequence discrimination and gating, suggesting that specific arrest motifs within nascent chain sequences may induce a similar gating mechanism.",2003,37,173,4,6,23,19,16,10,11,20,12,16,9

The protein contains two iron-sulfur clusters, one of which ([3Fe-4S]) is believed to play a central role in the electron-coupled proton transfer. Different charge sets for the [3Fe-4S] cluster in its reduced and oxidized state are calculated with broken symmetry ab initio density functional theory methods and used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The validity of the ab initio calculations is assessed by comparing partially optimized structures of the [3Fe-4S] clusters with x-ray structures. Possible proton transfer pathways between the protein and the iron-sulfur cluster are examined by both MD simulations and ab initio calculations. The MD simulations identify three main-chain hydrogen atoms--HN(13), HN(14), and HN(16)--that are within H-bonding distance of the [3Fe-4S] cluster throughout the MD simulations. They could thus play a role in the proton transfer from the protein to the iron-sulfur cluster. By contrast, the HD2(15) atom of the Asp-15 is seldom close enough to the [3Fe-4S] cluster to transfer a proton. Poisson-Boltzmann calculations indicate that there is a low, but nonzero probability, that Asp-15 is protonated at pH 7; this is a requirement for it to serve as a proton donor. Ab initio calculations with a fragment model for the protein find similar behavior for the transfer of a proton from the OH of the protonated side chain and the main-chain NH of Asp-15. The existence of a stable salt bridge between Asp-15 and Lys-84 in the D15E mutant, versus its absence in the wild-type, has been suggested as the cause of the difference in the rate of proton transfer. Extensive MD simulations were done to test this idea; the results do not support the proposal. The present findings, together with the available data, serve as the basis for an alternative proposal for the mechanism of the coupled electron-proton transfer reaction in ferredoxin I.",2004,55,15,0,0,1,0,3,3,0,0,3,1,3

Of the 39 Hox genes, Hoxa1 is the first to be expressed during embryogenesis and the only anterior Hox gene linked to a human syndrome. Hoxa1 is necessary for the proper development of the brainstem, inner ear and heart in humans and mice; however, almost nothing is known about the molecular downstream targets through which it exerts its function. To gain insight into the transcriptional network regulated by this protein, we performed microarray analysis on tissue microdissected from the prospective rhombomere 3-5 region of Hoxa1 null and wild type embryos. Due to the very early and transient expression of this gene, dissections were performed on early somite stage embryos during an eight-hour time window of development. Our array yielded a list of around 300 genes differentially expressed between the two samples. Many of the identified genes play a role in a specific developmental or cellular process. Some of the validated targets regulate early neural crest induction and specification. Interestingly, three of these genes, Zic1, Hnf1b and Foxd3, were down-regulated in the posterior hindbrain, where cardiac neural crest cells arise, which pattern the outflow tract of the heart. Other targets are necessary for early inner ear development, e.g. Pax8 and Fgfr3 or are expressed in specific hindbrain neurons regulating respiration, e.g. Lhx5. These findings allow us to propose a model where Hoxa1 acts in a genetic cascade upstream of genes controlling specific aspects of embryonic development, thereby providing insight into possible mechanisms underlying the human HoxA1-syndrome.",2011,66,51,3,1,2,7,7,4,3,9,6,2,8

Its fluorescence is strongly affected on complexation with various organic anions (carboxylates, sulfonates, phosphates), i.e. a strong increase of the monomer band is observed with concomitant disappearance of the excimer contribution. The fluorescence revival of 1, which arises from both conformational changes and specific electronic interactions with the substrate, allowed the determination of high stability constants for the 1 : 1 complexes (Ks ranging from 103 to 107 dm3 mol–1). The magnitude of this effect has been correlated in terms of relative fluorescence quantum yields (ΦR) to the selectivities observed (polyanion/monoanion; aromatic/aliphatic; chain length selectivity) and to the factors involved in the strength of the association (electrostatic and hydrophobic forces; structural complementarity). In the case of the naphthalene derivatives, the occurrence of a donor–acceptor energy transfer process demonstrates the formation of an association where the substrate and the receptor are in close proximity.

The [2]rotaxane exists in the ground-state co-conformation (GSCC) wherein the CBPQT4+ ring encircles the DNP unit. Reduction of the CBPQT4+ leads to the CBPQT2(•+) diradical dication while the P-BIPY2+ unit is reduced to its P-BIPY•+ radical cation. A radical-state co-conformation (RSCC) results from movement of the CBPQT2(•+) ring along the dumbbell to surround the P-BIPY•+ unit. This shuttling event induces IET to occur between the pyridinium redox centers of the P-BIPY•+ unit, a property which is absent between these redox centers in the free dumbbell and in the 1∶1 complex formed between the CBPQT2(•+) ring and the radical cation of methyl-phenylene-viologen (MPV•+).

Calculations based on the Bardeen-Pines collective treatment of the electron-phonon system show that in the long wave length region (k ≲kc ≅r s −1 wherers is the interelectronic spacing) only the plasmons respond to a longitudinal vector potential. Their response is such as to maintain gauge invariance. The individual electrons are surrounded with a screening cloud of virtual plasmons in such a way that they carry no longitudinal current to order (k2/k c 2 ), and are hence unaffected by a longitudinal vector potential to this order. The introduction of the screening cloud is shown to correspond closely to the backflow introduced byFeynman andCohen to guarantee longitudinal current conservation for the excitations in liquid helium. The calculations are carried out to orderm/M andk4/k c 4 , and involve the use of the random phase approximation for terms which couple plasmons and electrons. For the wave lengths of importance in the Meissner effect (k ≪kc), these approximations are well-justified. An explicit prescription is given for extending the Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer derivation of the Meissner effect to an arbitrary gauge, and their results are shown to be essentially unaltered.",1959,8,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A significant increase in the plasma LH response to LH-RH over pretreatment levels was noted after 1 month (10.2 +/- 4.2 mIU/ml versus 1.6 +/- 1.0 mIU/ml, P less than 0.001) and 3 months (3.0 +/- 1.6 mIU/ml, P less than 0.01) with a subsequent decline to pretreatment levels after 6 months of treatment. The follicle-stimulating hormone response to LH-RH was not significant. It is concluded that D-Trp6-LH-RH induced an initial stimulation in these patients but, probably because of the excessively high dose used, a paradoxical inhibitory response was obtained after 3 months of therapy.",1981,8,23,0,0,1,1,10,1,1,2,0,1,1

c1e2f473c176d9fa425de716a025752901932cb6,REMARKABLE STABILIZATION OF SELF-ASSEMBLED ORGANOGELS BY POLYMERIZATION,"In recent years a number of low molecular weight organic compounds have been found to be effective gelators for organic solvents. They have in common that in organic solution they self-assemble into elongated fiber-like structures through highly specific intermolecular interactions. These fibers in turn form a three-dimensional network encapsulating the solvent. The welldefined molecular arrangement within the fibers offers ample opportunity for the development of functional gels. Large open network structures with, for instance, recognition sites or electron conducting groups open new possibilities in areas such as catalysis, sensor technology, and materials science. However, organogels commonly suffer from instability, for instance, due to crystallization or lack of mechanical robustness. Furthermore, despite major achievements in supramolecular chemistry to achieve controlled self-assembly of organic molecules, until now most low molecular weight gelators have been found by serendipity rather then by design. Very recently, Hanabusa and co-workers and our group succeeded in the systematic design of novel gelators for organic solvents by exploiting the selfassembling properties of urea groups. Here we report a novel polymerizable organogelator for organic solvents, based on (1R,2R)-trans-1,2-bis(ureido)cyclohexane, and the formation of highly stable organogels. These systems differ from macromolecular gels in that the monomeric compound already forms gels through aggregation by extensive hydrogen-bond formation.",1997,1,179,0,0,2,16,11,13,5,6,7,17,11

f6d7ce5c61710a3ef59775a3970ead5e90f7cc90,The T4 glycoprotein is a cell-surface receptor for the AIDS virus.,"Taken together, our studies suggest a mechanism of AIDS virus infection that initially involves the specific association of the AIDS virus with T4 molecules on the cell surface. This association does not require additional T-cell-specific molecules and can be demonstrated on both B lymphocytes and epithelial cell lines. The T4-AIDS virus complex is likely to be internalized in endosomes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The virus can then fuse with the vacuolar membrane, releasing the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm to undergo uncoating. Viral replication does not appear to require the environment of a T lymphocyte because active infection is also observed in human T4+ B lymphocytes and epithelial cell lines. Moreover, the T4 gene is expressed in the brain as well as in lymphocytes, providing an explanation for the dual neurotropic and lymphotropic character of the virus. In this manner, a T-lymphocyte surface protein thought to be important in mediating effector cell-target cell interactions has been exploited by a human lymphotropic virus to target the AIDS virus specifically to populations of T4+ cells.",1986,0,42,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0

Functional studies from our laboratory previously demonstrated kinetically distinct SCFA transporters on the apical and basolateral membranes of human colonocytes. Although apical SCFA uptake is mediated by the MCT1 isoform, the molecular identity of the basolateral membrane SCFA transporter(s) and whether this transporter is encoded by another MCT isoform is not known. The present studies were designed to assess the expression and membrane localization of different MCT isoforms in human small intestine and colon. Immunoblotting was performed with the purified apical and basolateral membranes from human intestinal mucosa obtained from organ donor intestine. Immunohistochemistry studies were done on paraffin-embedded sections of human colonic biopsy samples. Immunoblotting studies detected a protein band of approximately 39 kDa for MCT1, predominantly in the apical membranes. The relative abundance of MCT1 mRNA and protein increased along the length of the human intestine. MCT4 (54 kDa) and MCT5 (54 kDa) isoforms showed basolateral localization and were highly expressed in the distal colon. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed that human MCT1 antibody labeling was confined to the apical membranes, whereas MCT5 antibody staining was restricted to the basolateral membranes of the colonocytes. We speculate that distinct MCT isoforms may be involved in SCFA transport across the apical or basolateral membranes in polarized colonic epithelial cells.",2005,39,175,10,2,4,10,14,3,16,13,11,10,13
82149cfcddfeb30fe3a57dbdcfd78ac1f08b81be,Dynamic regulation of miRNA expression in ordered stages of cellular development.,"Short RNA expression in several distinct stages of T-lymphocyte development was comprehensively profiled. The total number of microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed per cell at different stages of development varies over nearly an order of magnitude in parallel with changes in total cellular RNA content, suggesting that global miRNA levels are coregulated with the translational capacity of the cell. However, individual miRNAs were dynamically regulated during T-cell development, with at least one miRNA or miRNA family overrepresented at each developmental stage. miRNA regulation in this developmental pathway is characterized by analog rather than switch-like behavior, with temporal enrichments at distinct stages of development observed against a background of constant, basal expression of the miRNA. Enrichments of these miRNAs are temporally correlated with depletions of the transcript levels of targets containing seed matches to the specific miRNAs, and may have specific functional consequences. miR-181a, which is specifically enriched at the CD4(+)CD8(+) (DP) stage of thymocyte development, can repress the expression of Bcl-2, CD69, and the T-cell receptor, all of which are coordinately involved in positive selection.",2007,47,462,26,20,45,41,35,43,42,57,35,34,14

We analyzed the roles of OsATG10 genes, which are autophagy-related. Two rice ATG10 genes - OsATG10a and OsATG10b - share significant sequence homology (about 75%), and were ubiquitously expressed in all organs examined here. GUS assay indicated that OsATG10b was highly expressed in the mesophyll cells and vascular tissue of younger leaves, but its level of expression decreased in older leaves. We identified T-DNA insertional mutants in that gene. Those osatg10b mutants were sensitive to treatments with high salt and methyl viologen (MV). Monodansylcadaverine-staining experiments showed that the number of autophagosomes was significantly decreased in the mutants compared with the WT.

N-Coumaroyltyramine accumulates in plants in response to wounding and pathogen attack. Due to the scarcity of N-coumaroyltyramine, its biological activities have not been studied in human cells. In this study, N-coumaroyltyramine was chemically synthesized and then purified by an HPLC with a UV-visible absorbance detector. Retention times of major peaks were 14.3 and 20.7 min, and the peak at 20.7 min was confirmed by LC-MS as N-coumaroyltyramine with a mass/charge (m/z) unit of 284.1. The synthesis procedure was relatively easy and had an acceptable yield (approximately 55%). The compound exhibited a new activity, suppression of growth of human tumor cells such as U937 and Jurkat cells. In addition, the suppressed growth of the cells was strongly associated with an increased percentage of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle progression. Furthermore, N-coumaroyltyramine was able to inhibit the protein tyrosine kinases including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

Even when the two precursors do not absorb visible light, the resulting EDA complex often does. In 1952, Mulliken proposed a quantum-mechanical theory to rationalize the formation of such colored EDA complexes. However, and besides a few pioneering studies in the 20th century, it is only in the past few years that the EDA complex photochemistry has been recognized as a powerful strategy for expanding the potential of visible-light-driven radical synthetic chemistry. Here, we explain why this photochemical synthetic approach was overlooked for so long. We critically discuss the historical context, scientific reasons, serendipitous observations, and landmark discoveries that were essential for progress in the field. We also outline future directions and identify the key advances that are needed to fully exploit the potential of the EDA complex photochemistry.",2020,156,143,0,40,102,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We are interested in understanding how the more complex aptamers achieve higher affinities for the ligand. In vitro selection produces structural solutions to a functional problem that are are as simple as possible in terms of the information content needed to define them. It has long been assumed that the simplest way to improve the affinity of an aptamer is to increase the shape and functional group complementarity of the RNA binding pocket for the ligand. This argument underlies the hypothesis that selection for higher-affinity aptamers automatically leads to structures that bind more specifically to the target molecule. Here, we examined the binding specificities of the eleven GTP aptamers by carrying out competition binding studies with sixteen different chemical analogues of GTP. The aptamers have distinct patterns of specificity, implying that each RNA is a structurally unique solution to the problem of GTP binding. However, these experiments failed to provide evidence that higher-affinity aptamers bind more specifically to GTP. We suggest that the simplest way to improve aptamer K(d)s may be to increase the stability of the RNA tertiary structure with additional intramolecular RNA-RNA interactions; increasingly specific ligand binding may emerge only in response to direct selection for specificity.",2006,11,103,3,1,7,5,8,12,9,4,4,14,5

After prelabeling with 32PO4, exposure of the chromaffin cells to acetylcholine increased the phosphorylation of a Mr approximately equal to 100,000 protein and a Mr approximately equal to 60,000 protein (tyrosine hydroxylase), visualized after separation of total cellular proteins in naDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to three known phosphoproteins (""100-kDa,"" ""87-kDa,"" and protein III) revealed an acetylcholine-dependent phosphorylation of these proteins. These three proteins were also shown to be present in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells by immunolabeling techniques. ""100-kDa"" is a Mr approximately equal to 100,000 protein selectively phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III, ""87-kDa"" is a Mr approximately equal to 87,000 protein selectively phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and protein III is a phosphoprotein doublet of Mr approximately equal to 74,000 (IIIa) and Mr approximately equal to 55,000 (IIIb) phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I. Furthermore, 100-kDa was shown to be identical to the Mr approximately equal to 100,000 protein whose phosphorylation was increased by acetylcholine treatment. The acetylcholine-dependent increase in phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, 100-kDa, 87-kDa, and protein III required extracellular calcium and was mimicked by nicotine, veratridine, elevated K+, and calcium ionophore A23187, but not by muscarine. In addition, forskolin increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, 100-kDa, and protein III, but not that of 87-kDa. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, 87-kDa, and protein III, but not that of 100-kDa.

dc1ad9dc911c27520f882dd2344fa45ded30eacc,Biochemical characterization of a Naegleria TET-like oxygenase and its application in single molecule sequencing of 5-methylcytosine,"Significance The discovery that 5-methylcytosine (5mC) can be iteratively oxidized by mammalian ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins marks a breakthrough in the field of epigenetics. To better understand the evolutionary and functional linkage of TET family members, we characterized NgTET1 from the protist Naegleria gruberi, which bears homology to both TET and base J-binding protein, a thymidine hydroxylase in trypanosomes. We show that NgTET1 performs iterative oxidation of both 5mC and thymidine (T) (minor activity) on various DNA forms, and that these activities can be modulated by mutagenesis. We also present evidence for the effect of sequence context on both 5mC- and T-oxygenase activities. Finally, we show the utility of NgTET1 at direct methylome profiling using single-molecule, real-time sequencing. Modified DNA bases in mammalian genomes, such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidized forms, are implicated in important epigenetic regulation processes. In human or mouse, successive enzymatic conversion of 5mC to its oxidized forms is carried out by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins. Previously we reported the structure of a TET-like 5mC oxygenase (NgTET1) from Naegleria gruberi, a single-celled protist evolutionarily distant from vertebrates. Here we show that NgTET1 is a 5-methylpyrimidine oxygenase, with activity on both 5mC (major activity) and thymidine (T) (minor activity) in all DNA forms tested, and provide unprecedented evidence for the formation of 5-formyluridine (5fU) and 5-carboxyuridine (5caU) in vitro. Mutagenesis studies reveal a delicate balance between choice of 5mC or T as the preferred substrate. Furthermore, our results suggest substrate preference by NgTET1 to 5mCpG and TpG dinucleotide sites in DNA. Intriguingly, NgTET1 displays higher T-oxidation activity in vitro than mammalian TET1, supporting a closer evolutionary relationship between NgTET1 and the base J-binding proteins from trypanosomes. Finally, we demonstrate that NgTET1 can be readily used as a tool in 5mC sequencing technologies such as single molecule, real-time sequencing to map 5mC in bacterial genomes at base resolution.",2015,30,44,2,3,5,7,12,5,5,7,0,0,0

In the first step, multiple moieties of ubiquitin are covalently bound to target proteins to be recognized and degraded by the multi-enzymatic proteasome complex in the second step. In addition to the elimination of damaged and unneeded proteins, this system fulfills an important function in the regulation of cellular mediators in various biological pathways. Foremost, these biological pathways include inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, all of which constitute important characteristics of atherosclerosis. Indeed, recent experimental evidence supports a potential involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the initiation, progression, and complication stage of atherogenesis.

However, in most cases it is unclear whether disease is caused by insufficient immunity, delayed immunity against infectious agents or by autoimmunity (i.e., reactivity to a “normal” self). The present summary is a biased view of immunological pathogenic principles that may explain some of the questions henceforth. Two proposals will be illustrated. Firstly, T cell mediated immune protection is mediated by cell destruction, i.e., pathology, therefore both beneficial and harmful effects of T cell responses against foreign, mostly infectious, antigens will be the result of the balance between kinetics of immune response and infectious agents. Secondly, if one knows the causative agent, the immunologically mediated disease is called “immunopathological” whereas if a new or trivial causative agent is not recognized the disease is called “autoimmune”.",1993,55,11,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,0

The non-specific binding of the repressor to DNA protected the minor groove but apparently not the major groove of the DNA double helix against methylation and did not increase the content of single stranded DNA regions. This suggests that the repressor on binding to non-operator DNA makes contacts mainly in the minor groove of DNA and does not uncoil the DNA double helix.

Here, we report the isolation of a yeast TBP-TAFII complex which can mediate transcriptional activation by GAL4-VP16 in a highly purified yeast in vitro transcription system. We have cloned and sequenced the genes encoding four of the multiple yeast TAFII proteins comprising the TBP-TAFII multisubunit complex and find that they are similar at the amino acid level to both human and Drosophila TFIID subunits. Using epitope-tagging and immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate that these genes encode bona fide TAF proteins and show that the yeast TBP-TAFII complex is minimally composed of TBP and seven distinct yTAFII proteins ranging in size from M(r) = 150,000 to M(r) = 25,000.

a64dee777f9208f00efd77401e55c8e1a1e682e8,Transformation of Immature Lymphoid Cells by Abelson Murine Leukemia Virus,"Leukemia viruses have a special interest for Immunologists because many of them transform cells of the lymphocyte lineage into contitiuously growing permanent lines of cells. One of the most useful of such viruses is the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) (Rosenberg & Baltimore 1979). This virus is able to generate lines of cells with properties that suggest the cells are counterparts of various stages of B-lymphocyte differentiation. The ability of a virus to transform a specific lineage of cells raises a wide range ofquestions. These questions include: What genetic elements of the virus play a role in Its transformation ability? What proteins are made by the virus that play a role in transformation? How do these proteins work? What kind of cell is a target for the virus? What characteristics can be used to define the differentiation state of the resulting tumor cells? Can such tumor cells be used to understand the normal process of differentiation? In this review we will attempt to summarize the present state of knowledge about these various questions in relation to A-MuLV and suggest the types of information that may be derived from future studies. A-MuLV came to light during an experiment in which Abelson & Rabstein (1970 a,b) infected steroid-treated BALB/cCr mice with Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) (Fig. 1). One of the mice in the study developed a lymphosarcoma 37 days after virus infection. This tumor involved the cervical and inguinal lymph nodes, the lower vertebral column, the marrow of the calvaria and the meninges. No evidence of a thymic tumor was present. Histologically, the tumor cells were indistinguishable from other virus-induced lymphoma cells. The lymphoblasticcells were oflarge size with a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. The nucleus was characterized by diffuse chromatin and a prominent nucleolus and the cytoplasm had abundant free ribosomes (Rabstein etal. 1971, Siegler etal. 1972).",1979,68,61,0,0,3,3,7,7,6,7,5,7,1

However, all known conditions for the chemical copying of an RNA template result in the synthesis of a complementary strand that contains a mixture of 2'-5' and 3'-5' linkages, rather than the selective synthesis of only 3'-5' linkages as found in contemporary RNA. Here we show that such backbone heterogeneity is compatible with RNA folding into defined three-dimensional structures that retain molecular recognition and catalytic properties and, therefore, would not prevent the evolution of functional RNAs such as ribozymes. Moreover, the same backbone heterogeneity lowers the melting temperature of RNA duplexes that would otherwise be too stable for thermal strand separation. By allowing copied strands to dissociate, this heterogeneity may have been one of the essential features that allowed RNA to emerge as the first biopolymer.",2013,47,76,4,9,14,13,8,12,9,4,3,3,0

Since then various hydride reagents have evolved for the convenient reduction of typical organic functional groups. Electrophilic reducing agents such as borane and alane possess markedly different reducing characteristics than those of nucleophilic reducing agents such as sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride. Explorations have revealed means of both enhancing and diminishing the electrophilic character of borane and alane on the one hand and both enhancing and diminishing the nucleophilic character of borohydrides and aluminohydrides on the other. Such derivatives reveal unique characteristics making possible valuable selective reductions, not practical previously.

Three strong binding sites for magnesium have been identified, and their co-ordination is described.

The co-ordinations of platinum, osmium, mercury and samarium (all used to prepare derivatives for X-ray analysis) are described. Difference Fourier maps have revealed one major binding site for each of cobalt and managanese in the presence of magnesium.

The earliest significant decrease noted is usually in the number of the lymphocytes. From the study of lymph nodes and bone marrow during the incubation period and throughout the illness, it appears that failure of leucopoiesis is the cause of leucopenia. Inclusion bodies in the primitive blood cells of the marrow suggest a direct action of the virus on these cells. When recovery occurs a marked myelogenous leucemoid response is noted. Available data indicate the presence of a mild anemia due to a failure in erythropoiesis, less marked than the leucopenia probably because of the longer life of the adult circulating erythrocytes. The erythrocytes appear to have an increased fragility and the serum has a slight increase in icterus, suggesting an increased mean erythrocyte age. During recovery erythropoiesis does not begin until after the myeloid marrow response has begun to subside, due possibly to previous mechanical crowding of the marrow by the more rapidly growing myeloblasts and myelocytes.",1939,14,16,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We demonstrate that Nod2−/− and Ripk2−/− mice are hypersusceptible to infection with influenza A virus. Ripk2−/− cells exhibited defective autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy), leading to enhanced mitochondrial production of superoxide and accumulation of damaged mitochondria, which resulted in greater activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and production of IL-18. RIPK2 regulated mitophagy in a kinase-dependent manner by phosphorylating the mitophagy inducer ULK1. Accordingly, Ulk1−/− cells exhibited enhanced mitochondrial production of superoxide and activation of caspase-1. These results demonstrate a role for NOD2-RIPK2 signaling in protection against virally triggered immunopathology by negatively regulating activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and production of IL-18 via ULK1-dependent mitophagy.",2013,70,260,8,12,31,35,30,22,44,25,39,22,0

These antibodies prevent compaction of preimplantation embryos (or trigger their decompaction) and have similar effects on embryonal carcinoma cells. They probably act through the masking of specific molecules (Fab targets) involved in the mechanisms of recognition between cells during compaction. Fab target molecules have been extracted from embryonal carcinoma cell membranes and purified using their property to inhibit the effects mediated by anti-embryonal carcinoma Fab. The solubilization of the Fab targets could be achieved using both detergent extraction and trypsin treatment of membranes. In the latter case, a glycoprotein of 84,000 daltons could be purified which has all the properties expected from the Fab target and accounts for most of the Fab-inhibiting activity of embryonal carcinoma cell membranes.",1980,23,394,1,0,6,13,15,20,17,25,17,15,11

We have now used immunoelectron microscopy to determine the subcellular site of neuronal beta-amyloid in normal and Alzheimer brains, and in brains from Alzheimer transgenic mice.

Energy transfer between chlorophyll b and a within a monolayer has also been investigated, and found to involve essentially irreversible transfer of excitation energy from b to a. Experiments involving the quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence by quinones in the monolayer leads to the conclusion that the efficiency of quinone quenching is not enhanced at high chlorophyll concentrations.

In general, the actual coil diameter found in this way is much larger than that calculated from a model with free rotation. (For polystyrene in benzene the factor is about 3.5.) This increase in size can satisfactorily be attributed to hindering of rotation around the chemical bonds. In order to obtain information about structural details of this hindered rotation, however, the size determination will have to be combined with evidence derived from other sources than light scattering. As such, the dipole moment, as derived from measurements of the dielectric constant of polymer solutions, obviously is a good choice.

Its peptidyl transferase activity has often been studied using a 'fragment assay' that depends on high concentrations of methanol or ethanol. Here we describe a version of this assay that does not require alcohol and use it to show, both crystallographically and biochemically, that crystals of the large ribosomal subunits from Haloarcula marismortui are enzymatically active. Addition of these crystals to solutions containing substrates results in formation of products, which ceases when crystals are removed. When substrates are diffused into large subunit crystals, the subsequent structure shows that products have formed. The CC-puromycin-peptide product is found bound to the A-site and the deacylated CCA is bound to the P-site, with its 3′ OH near N3 A2486 (Escherichia coli A2451).

Here we evaluated the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to expand alloantigen-specific Tregs in the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) that develops from polyclonal populations of T cells. The allogeneic DCs, when supplemented with IL-2 in the cultures, were much more effective than bulk spleen cells in expanding the numbers of Tregs. Likewise, DCs and not spleen cells were effective in sustaining expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 in Tregs, but neither IL-2 nor CD80/86 was required for this effect in the cultures. On a per-cell basis, the DC-expanded, but not unexpanded, Tregs were more potent suppressors of a fresh MLR by CD25- CD4+ T cells. Suppression was 3- to 10-fold more active for MLRs induced by the original alloantigens than for third-party stimulators. When DC-expanded Tregs were introduced into sublethally irradiated hosts, the T cells suppressed graft-versus-host-disease induced by CD25- CD4+ T cells. Again, suppression was more active against the same mouse strain that provided the DCs to expand the Tregs. Therefore, alloantigen-selected Tregs are more effective suppressors of responses to major transplantation antigens, and these Tregs can be expanded from a polyclonal repertoire by DCs.",2006,30,204,14,6,39,27,28,17,22,18,13,7,3

We have studied the molecular requirements for antibody‐mediated neutralization of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in vitro and protection against lethal disease in vivo with a single‐chain Fv fragment (scFv) and the corresponding bivalent miniantibody (scFv‐dHLX) generated from a VSV‐neutralizing monoclonal antibody. Both monovalent scFv and bivalent scFv‐dHLX miniantibodies were able to neutralize VSV in vitro and to protect interferon‐αβ receptor‐deficient (IFN‐αβR−/−) mice against lethal disease after intravenous injection of 50 plaque‐forming units (pfu) VSV pre‐incubated with the scFv reagents. Similarly, severe‐combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice infected with immune complexes of 108 pfu VSV and bivalent scFv‐dHLX were protected against lethal disease; however, mice infected with immune complexes of 108 pfu VSV and monovalent scFv were not. Although repeated scFv‐dHLX treatment reduced virus quantities in the blood, neither SCID nor IFN‐αβR−/− mice were protected against lethal disease after passive immunization and subsequent VSV infection. This was due to the short half‐life of 17 min of scFv‐dHLX in the circulation. These data demonstrate that neutralization of VSV and protection against lethal disease do not require Fc‐mediated mechanisms and that cross‐linking is not crucial for protection against physiologically relevant virus doses in vivo.",1996,28,34,0,0,6,2,2,2,4,1,5,1,2

The QW resonance energy was shifted to lower energy by the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) due to the internal piezoelectric field, F PZ . The absorption spectrum was modulated by QCSE and quantum-confined Franz–Keldysh effect (QCFK) for the wells, in which, for the first approximation, the product of F PZ and L (potential drop across the well) exceeds the valence band discontinuity, Δ E V . In this case, dressed holes are confined in the triangular potential well formed at one side of the well. This produces apparent Stokes-like shift (vertical component). The QCFK further modulated the absorption energy for the wells with L greater than the three dimensional free exciton Bohr radius, a B . For the wells having high InN content ( F PZ × L >Δ E V , Δ E C ), electron and hole confined levels drop into the triangular potential wells formed at opposite sides of the wells, which reduces the wavefunction overlap. Doping of Si in the barriers partially screens F PZ resulting in a smaller Stokes-like shift, shorter recombination decay time, and higher emission efficiency. Si-doping was found to improve the interface quality and surface morphology, resulting in an efficient carrier transfer from high to low bandgap energy portions of the well. Effective in-plane localization of carriers in quantum disk size potential minima, which are produced by nonrandom alloy potential fluctuations enhanced by the large bowing parameter and F PZ , produces confined e–h pair whose wavefunctions are still overlapped. Their excitonic features are pronounced provided that L a B and F PZ × L E V (quantized exciton).

Great advances have been made, especially in our understanding of the fundamental photochemical processes which govern the ozone distribution of the atmosphere. Altogether this decade has seen so many unforeseen developments that it will be difficult to find another field in atmospheric science which has provided a comparable amount of excitement.",1979,140,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

f3ef86e74c3cf5e1f4a1bdf4723031d82e5dab84,Structural investigations of the CuA centre of nitrous oxide reductase from Pseudomonas stutzeri by site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.,"Nitrous oxide reductase is the terminal component of a respiratory chain that utilizes N2O in lieu of oxygen. It is a homodimer carrying in each subunit the electron transfer site, CuA, and the substrate-reducing catalytic centre, CuZ. Spectroscopic data have provided robust evidence for CuA as a binuclear, mixed-valence metal site. To provide further structural information on the CuA centre of N2O reductase, site directed mutagenesis and Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic investigation have been undertaken. Candidate amino acids as ligands for the CuA centre of the enzyme from Pseudomonas stutzeri ATCC14405 were substituted by evolutionary conserved residues or amino acids similar to the wild-type residues. The mutations identified the amino acids His583, Cys618, Cys622 and Met629 as ligands of Cu1, and Cys618, Cys622 and His626 as the minimal set of ligands for Cu2 of the CuA centre. Other amino acid substitutions indicated His494 as a likely ligand of CuZ, and an indirect role for Asp580, compatible with a docking function for the electron donor. Cu binding and spectroscopic properties of recombinant N2O reductase proteins point at intersubunit or interdomain interaction of CuA and CuZ. Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectra have been recorded to investigate the local environment of the Cu centres in N2O reductase. Cu K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) for binuclear Cu chemical systems show clear evidence for Cu backscattering at approximately 2.5 A. The Cu K-edge EXAFS of the CuA centre of N2O reductase is very similar to that of the CuA centre of cytochrome c oxidase and the optimum simulation of the experimental data involves backscattering from a histidine group with Cu-N of 1.92 A, two sulfur atoms at 2.24 A and a Cu atom at 2. 43 A, and allows for the presence of a further light atom (oxygen or nitrogen) at 2.05 A. The interpretation of the CuA EXAFS is in line with ligands assigned by site-directed mutagenesis. By a difference spectrum approach, using the Cu K-edge EXAFS of the holoenzyme and that of the CuA-only form, histidine was identified as a major contributor to the backscattering. A structural model for the CuA centre of N2O reductase has been generated on the basis of the atomic coordinates for the homologous domain of cytochrome c oxidase and incorporating our current results and previous spectroscopic data.",2000,73,43,0,0,2,2,3,2,2,6,3,2,0

Depending on the alkali-metal precoverage, two different scenarios exist for the structural evolution of the surfaces. For alkali-metal coverages ${\mathrm{\ensuremath{\theta}}}_{\mathrm{alk}}$\ensuremath{\le}0.13 ML [${\mathrm{\ensuremath{\theta}}}_{\mathrm{alk}}$=0.13 corresponds to the (1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}3) missing-row reconstructed Cu(110) surface], oxygen adsorption leads first to a transient contraction of the missing rows into islands of a (1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}2) structure. After longer exposures it causes the local removal of the alkali-metal-induced reconstruction, and the (2\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}1) Cu-O ``added-row'' structure with ${\mathrm{\ensuremath{\theta}}}_{\mathrm{O}}$=0.5 is formed. In this structure the alkali-metal atoms are incorporated in the Cu-O chains. For higher alkali-metal precoverages, in the range of the (1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}2) reconstruction (${\mathrm{\ensuremath{\theta}}}_{\mathrm{alk}}$\ensuremath{\approxeq}0.2), more than one-half a monolayer of oxygen can be incorporated into the (1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}2) phase with only a minor structural effect before, at higher oxygen coverages, complex oxygen\char21{}alkali-metal\char21{}Cu structures with oxygen coverages well above 0.5 ML are formed. The saturation oxygen coverage is drastically enhanced beyond ${\mathrm{\ensuremath{\theta}}}_{\mathrm{O}}$=0.5, the quasisaturation value of the clean surface. Based on mass-transport arguments the substrate is reconstructed for all ratios of oxygen and alkali metal investigated here. Hence, adsorbate-substrate interactions are essential for these structures; they are not dominated by interactions between alkali metals and oxygen, i.e., by adsorbate-adsorbate interactions.",1994,0,13,0,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,1,0,0

HBxAg was common in the liver among patients with chronic hepatitis independent of HBV replication markers but was closely correlated with elevated alanine aminotransferase, implying that HBxAg in liver may be important in the pathogenesis of chronic infection.

The farnesyltransferase that catalyzes this reaction recognizes tetrapeptides of the sequence CAAX, where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is a carboxyl-terminal methionine or serine. Replacement of the two aliphatic residues with a benzodiazepine-based mimic of a peptide turn generated potent inhibitors of farnesyltransferase [50 percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) < 1 nM]. Unlike tetrapeptides, the benzodiazepine peptidomimetics enter cells and block attachment of farnesyl to Ras, nuclear lamins, and several other proteins. At micromolar concentrations, these inhibitors restored a normal growth pattern to Ras-transformed cells. The benzodiazepine peptidomimetics may be useful in the design of treatments for tumors in which oncogenic Ras proteins contribute to abnormal growth, such as that of the colon, lung, and pancreas.",1993,42,571,9,7,42,85,32,52,40,55,46,28,20

Psoralen-modified triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) have been used to target ICLs to specific genomic sites to increase the selectivity of these agents. However, how TFO-directed psoralen ICLs (Tdp-ICLs) are recognized and processed in human cells is unclear. Previously, we reported that two essential nucleotide excision repair (NER) protein complexes, XPA–RPA and XPC–RAD23B, recognized ICLs in vitro, and that cells deficient in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) complex MutSβ were sensitive to psoralen ICLs. To further investigate the role of MutSβ in ICL repair and the potential interaction between proteins from the MMR and NER pathways on these lesions, we performed electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of MutSβ and NER proteins with Tdp-ICLs. We found that MutSβ bound to Tdp-ICLs with high affinity and specificity in vitro and in vivo, and that MutSβ interacted with XPA–RPA or XPC–RAD23B in recognizing Tdp-ICLs. These data suggest that proteins from the MMR and NER pathways interact in the recognition of ICLs, and provide a mechanistic link by which proteins from multiple repair pathways contribute to ICL repair.",2009,44,89,4,4,14,12,6,10,7,5,4,5,5

The efficiency varies largely with the load P, being zero at P = 0 and P = P0 (isometric). Near its maximum around P /P0 = 0·5 the efficiency (in frog sartorii at 0 °C) is consistently about 0·45. The form of the relation between efficiency and load is discussed, particularly in view of recent findings on the heat of shortening of muscle. The mechanical power developed during shortening is greatest when P/P0 = v/v0 = about 0·3; but the efficiency here is only 3 to 5% less than its maximum.",1964,5,111,8,2,2,0,0,1,1,2,2,0,0

Here we demonstrate an optical tweezer assay to measure the rupture force between a single ribosome complex and mRNA. The rupture force was compared between ribosome complexes assembled on an mRNA with and without a strong Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence—a sequence found just upstream of the coding region of bacterial mRNAs, involved in translation initiation. The removal of the SD sequence significantly reduced the rupture force in complexes carrying an aminoacyl tRNA, Phe-tRNAPhe, in the A site, indicating that the SD interactions contribute significantly to the stability of the ribosomal complex on the mRNA before peptide bond formation. In contrast, the presence of a peptidyl tRNA analogue, N-acetyl-Phe-tRNAPhe, in the A site, which mimicked the post-peptidyl transfer state, weakened the rupture force as compared to the complex with Phe-tRNAPhe, and the resultant force was the same for both the SD-containing and SD-deficient mRNAs. These results suggest that formation of the first peptide bond destabilizes the SD interaction, resulting in the weakening of the force with which the ribosome grips an mRNA. This might be an important requirement to facilitate movement of the ribosome along mRNA during the first translocation step.",2007,17,103,1,4,14,18,15,10,9,8,5,5,7

The prion protein (PrP) is found in amyloid of animals with scrapie and humans with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; the beta protein is present in amyloid deposits in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome patients. These two proteins are derived from precursors that in the brain are expressed primarily in neurons and are membrane bound. We found that gene expression for PrP and the beta-protein precursor (beta-PP) is regulated in developing hamster brain. Specific brain regions showed distinct patterns of ontogenesis for PrP and beta-PP mRNAs. The increases in PrP and beta-PP mRNAs in developing basal forebrain coincided with an increase in choline acetyltransferase activity, raising the possibility that these markers might be coordinately controlled in cholinergic neurons and regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF). Injections of NGF into the brains of neonatal hamsters increased both PrP and beta-PP mRNA levels. Increased PrP and beta-PP mRNA levels induced by NGF were confined to regions that contain NGF-responsive cholinergic neurons and were accompanied by elevations in choline acetyltransferase. It remains to be established whether or not exogenous NGF acts to increase PrP and beta-PP gene expression selectively in forebrain cholinergic neurons in the developing hamster and endogenous NGF regulates expression of these genes.",1988,0,240,1,0,13,18,26,22,18,21,11,8,10

Not only were they the first type of antibiotic to be widely accepted in medical practice, but their manufacture provided a powerful stimulant for the growth of the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, they still represent the most important and widely dispensed group of antibiotics in current use (Hewitt 1967). Several thousand tons of the penicillins are produced annually. Modern production methods have reduced the cost to a few pence per gram. As a consequence one should now regard the penicillins as a potentially useful raw material, suitable as a starting-point for the synthesis of a variety of derivatives. As an example one may quote the use of penicillins as precursors for the synthesis of the related, very useful antibiotics, the cephalosporins. The penam 1 and cephem 2 systems have similar chemical structures notable in possessing the identical β-lactam grouping 3 and the same C5 isoprenoid-like unit [to the right of the dotted lines in 1 and 2.] The systems differ in that the cephalosporins possess a higher oxidation level than the penicillins and a different substitution pattern on the C5 unit.",1971,0,6,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0

BLA neurons project to the central amygdala (CeA), which also participates in negative and positive behaviors. However, the CeA has primarily been studied as the site for negative behaviors, and the causal role for CeA circuits underlying appetitive behaviors is poorly understood. Here, we identify several genetically distinct populations of CeA neurons that mediate appetitive behaviors and dissect the BLA-to-CeA circuit for appetitive behaviors. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B+ BLA pyramidal neurons to dopamine receptor 1+ CeA neurons define a pathway for promoting appetitive behaviors, while R-spondin 2+ BLA pyramidal neurons to dopamine receptor 2+ CeA neurons define a pathway for suppressing appetitive behaviors. These data reveal genetically defined neural circuits in the amygdala that promote and suppress appetitive behaviors analogous to the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia.

3. Cutting the greater splanchnic nerves in the thorax causes secretion from the duodenum, but not from the lower levels of the small intestine. 
 
 
 
4. Cutting all the preganglionic sympathetic fibres causes secretion from all the small intestine. 
 
 
 
5. The ganglia of the solar plexus exert an inhibitory influence on secretion after section of the preganglionic fibres. 
 
 
 
6. The subcutaneous administration of eserine causes secretion from all the small intestine. 
 
 
 
7. The concomitant administration of eserine and acetylcholine may cause extreme damage to the intestinal mucosa. 
 
 
 
8. Stimulation of the Nervi Erigentes has no influence on the secretion of the small intestine. 
 
 
 
9. Histamine has no influence on the secretion of the small intestine. 
 
 
 
10. Certain anaesthetics abolish or considerably reduce secretory activity produced by the above methods. 
 
 
 
11. Atropine also abolishes it. 
 
 
 
12. Confirmation has been obtained of the presence of a secretory hormone acting on the first part of the duodenum in cats. A similar hormone has been shown to be present in pigs. In dogs, innervated fistulae cease to secrete after 24 hours' starvation and recommence soon after feeding. 
 
 
 
13. Duodenal secretion obtained experimentally contains amylase and enterokinase. It does not contain protease or peptidase. It sometimes contains traces of invertase and lipase, but their digestive power is insignificant. 
 
 
 
14. The duodenal secretions of five different species of animal and of both denervated and innervated fistulae have the same digestive properties. 
 
 
 
15. In a few experiments no differences were found between the digestive properties of secretion from the duodenum and from other levels of the small intestine.

Mountain peak and airplane observations,"The elimination in penetrating ray experiments of temperature and pressure effects is accomplished through new features in the design of Wulf electroscopes, but especially through immediate reduction in situ of all deflections to volts. 
 
Variation of penetrating radiation with altitude and with time of day. — When suitable precautions are taken for eliminating the activity of adjacent rocks, both airplane and mountain peak observations agree in showing a definite variation of the penetrating radiation with altitude alone. Within the limits of experimental error all observations are consistent in showing no dependence of the penetrating radiation upon the time of day or upon the position of heavenly bodies. 
 
Absorption coefficients of penetrating rays. — Absorption experiments made on Pikes Peak with lead sheets 4.8 cm thick furnish evidence for the existence on mountain peaks of copious new rays of local origin of no greater hardness than that of gamma rays. If these new rays are assumed to be homogeneous their absorption coefficient is about 3.1 per meter of water. These experiments, however, furnish no definite evidence for the existence of very penetrating rays of cosmic origin. 
 
Necessary characteristics of cosmic rays if they exist — Such rays cannot produce as much as 2 ions per cc per sec. at sea level if they have an absorption coefficient not less than 0.25 per meter of water.

The important factors in selecting therapy are efficacy of eradication, prevention of resistance, avoidance or minimization of adverse effects, patient compliance, and cost. The most effective regimens include a bismuth preparation or antisecretory drug (proton pump inhibitor or H2 receptor antagonist) plus two antibiotics administered for 14 days. Dual-drug therapies are not recommended. Triple-drug regimens are more likely to eradicate H pylori and less likely to generate resistant strains among surviving organisms. In general, cure of the infection should be confirmed 4 weeks after completion of the treatment. Antibiotic resistance is an important consideration in choosing therapy, and patients should be taught the importance of compliance. When treatment fails, antibiotic combinations should not be repeated.

The search for physical correlates of memory, the memory engram, has been a longstanding endeavor in modern neurobiology. Recent advances in transgenic and optogenetic tools have enabled the identification, visualization, and manipulations of natural, sensory-evoked, engram cells for a specific memory residing in specific brain regions.

6e4f5ec258b7d6f70ff5d99aeadc494ffcbb2707,Exhaled methyl nitrate as a noninvasive marker of hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes,"Recent technical advances allow detection of several hundred volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human exhaled air, many of which reflect unidentified endogenous pathways. Our group has previously estimated plasma glucose levels in healthy adults during a standard oral glucose tolerance test via exhaled VOC analysis. As a result of the metabolic characteristics of hyperglycemia in the diabetic (low insulin and increased free fatty acids and ketones), we hypothesized that different exhaled VOC profiles may be present in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) during spontaneous hyperglycemia. Exhaled methyl nitrate strongly correlated specifically with the acute, spontaneous hyperglycemia of T1DM children. Eighteen experiments were conducted among 10 T1DM children. Plasma glucose and exhaled gases were monitored during either constant euglycemia (n = 5) or initial hyperglycemia with gradual correction (n = 13); all subjects received i.v. insulin and glucose as needed. Gas analysis was performed on 1.9-liter breath samples via gas chromatography using electron capture, flame ionization, and mass selective detection. Among the ≈100 measured exhaled gases, the kinetic profile of exhaled methyl nitrate, commonly present in room air in the range of 5–10 parts per trillion, was most strongly statistically correlated with that of plasma glucose (P = 0.003–0.001). Indeed, the kinetic profiles of the two variables paralleled each other in 16 of 18 experiments, including repeat subjects who at different times displayed either euglycemia or hyperglycemia.",2007,47,139,3,0,2,9,7,14,10,13,16,14,8

Here, we investigated the roles of two immune system-expressed microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-155 and miR-146a, in the regulation of antitumor immune responses. Our results indicate that miR-155 promotes and miR-146a inhibits interferon γ (IFNγ) responses by T cells and reduces solid tumor growth in vivo. Using a double-knockout (DKO) mouse strain deficient in both miR-155 and miR-146a, we have also identified an epistatic relationship between these two miRNAs. DKO mice had defective T cell responses and tumor growth phenotypes similar to miR-155(-/-) mice. Further analysis of the T cell compartment revealed that miR-155 modulates IFNγ expression through a mechanism involving repression of Ship1. Our work reveals critical roles for miRNAs in the reciprocal regulation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immunity and demonstrates the dominant nature of miR-155 during its promotion of immune responses.",2012,50,145,3,0,11,17,24,15,13,17,15,15,17

e46d63c7dd54c65a3c2922630bf49d484507b441,Identification of ten genes that control ribosome formation in yeast,"SummaryTwenty-three temperature-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all of which undergo a rapid cessation of net RNA accumulation following a shift from the permissive (23°) to the restrictive temperature (36°), have been characterized. Genetic studies demonstrate that these mutants belong to ten different complementation groups and that, in most cases, their properties are the result of a single, recessive mutation in a nuclear gene. Although the mutants were isolated for heat sensitivity, mutants from 2 of the complementation groups are cold sensitive (at 13°) as well. The mutants continue to synthesize protein, including an enzyme, alkaline phosphatase, for two to four hours following a shift from 23° to 36°, suggesting that they are capable of messenger RNA synthesis and the translation of messenger RNA with fidelity at the restrictive temperature. The small amount of RNA that is synthesized in these mutants at the restrictive temperature has been examined on sucrose gradients and by acrylmide gel electrophoresis; in addition, the RNA components in polyribosomes have been fractionated by a new technique that separates messenger RNA from ribosomal RNA. As a result of these analyses we conclude that these mutants are strongly inhibited in the accumulation of 5S, 7S, 17S, and 25S RNA components but are only slight if at all inhibited in the synthesis of messenger RNA and 4S RNA. The results reported here define ten genes, designated rna 2 through rna 11, that play an essential role in the formation or maturation of ribosomes in yeast.",2004,23,53,3,8,1,0,1,1,3,1,1,2,2

DLA identity was determined by serological histocompability typing and mutual nonreactivity in mixed leukocyte culture. Sixteen dogs were given only DMM before the hemopoietic graft: two never showed evidence of marrow engraftment, six had initial engraftment but subsequently rejected the graft, and eight had sustained engraftment. Four of the eight were alive between days 557 and 739. Ninety-seven, 70, and 65%, respectively, of metaphases analyzed in their marrows, peripheral blood, and lymph nodes showed the donor karyotype. Ten dogs were given antithymocyte serum (ATS) for 6 days before DMM and the hemopoietic graft: one had initial engraftment but subsequently rejected the graft and nine had sustained engraftment. Eight of the nine were alive between 174 and 382 days. Between 82 and 97% of their hemopoietic cells showed the donor karyotype. Three dogs were given a combination of procarbazine and ATS for 6 days before DMM and the hemopoietic graft: all three had sustained engraftment, and 99 to 100% of their hemopoietic cells showed the donor karyotype. In conclusion, a dose of 10 mg of DMM per kg was sufficiently immunosuppressive to permit sustained engraftment of DLA-identical marrow in 50% of the dogs studied. Fifty percent of the dogs rejected the graft, presumably as a result of resistance to “minor” histocompability systems not associated with DLA. The addition of ATS or procarbazine and ATS to DMM successfully abrogated resistance. Its profound antitumor activity with marrow toxicity reversible by marrow transplantation combined with its moderate immunosuppressive properties suggest that DMM is useful in combination with other agents to condition human patients with hematologic malignancy for marrow transplantation.",1977,0,68,0,0,1,3,7,1,2,1,1,2,1

In vitro, our previous studies showed that cdc2 kinase phosphorylates Thr-320 (T320) in PP-1, and that this leads to inhibition of enzyme activity. To examine directly the phosphorylation of PP-1 in intact mammalian cells, an antibody has been prepared that specifically recognizes PP-1C alpha phosphorylated at T320. Cell synchronization studies revealed in a variety of cell types that T320 of PP-1 was phosphorylated to high levels only during early to mid-mitosis. The phosphorylation of T320 of PP-1 was reduced by the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, olomoucine, and increased by the PP-1/PP-2A inhibitor, calyculin A. Immunofluorescence microscopy using phospho-T320 antibody indicated that in NIH 3T3 cells the phosphorylation of PP-1 began to increase from basal levels in prophase and to peak at metaphase. Immunostaining indicated that phospho-PP-1 was localized exclusively to nonchromosomal regions. Furthermore, in cell fractionation studies of mitotic cells, phospho-PP-1 was detectable only in the soluble fraction. These observations suggest that phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase in early to mid-mitosis and inhibition of PP-1 activity is likely to contribute to the increased state of phosphorylation of proteins that is critical to the initiation of normal cell division.",1997,46,196,12,0,8,9,6,3,10,3,11,5,11

HCYS and 3-DZA inhibited chemotaxis, phospholipid methylation, and protein carboxymethylation in a dose-dependent manner. The chemotactic peptide- stimulated release of [14C]arachidonic acid previously incorporated into phospholipid was also partially blocked by the methyltransferase inhibitors. Stimulation by fMet-Leu-Phe or the calcium ionophore A23187 caused release of arachidonic acid but not of previously incorporated [14C]-labeled linoleic, oleic, or stearic acids. Unlike the arachidonic acid release caused by fMet-Leu-Phe, release stimulated by the ionophore could not be inhibited by HCYS and 3-DZA, suggesting that the release was caused by a different mechanism or by stimulating a step after methylation in the pathway from receptor activation to arachidonic acid release. Extracellular calcium was required for arachidonic acid release, and methyltransferase inhibitors were found to partially inhibit chemotactic peptide-stimulated calcium influx. These results suggest that methylation pathways may be associated with the chemotactic peptide receptor stimulation of calcium influx and activation of a phospholipase A2 specific for cleaving arachidonic acid from phospholipids.",1982,63,50,0,0,4,8,8,1,4,2,3,3,4

The relative yields of on-dimer (OD), inter-dimer (ID), and inter-row (IR) products, reported here for the first time, were unaltered by temperature change, indicative of barrier-free reaction. Inter-dimer reaction was found experimentally to be overwhelmingly the favored reaction path at all temperatures, 175–300 K. This is a preference that theory accounts for by a combination of kinematics favoring the initial approach of H, and subsequent charge-displacement directing the halogen atom to an inter-dimer site. Molecular dynamics, with statistical sampling of the initial collision-geometry at the surface, showed that the light H-atom invariably was the first to engage with the surface, forming H–Si.

We have used molecular cloning strategies to characterize a lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase gene distinct from but closely related to src and yes. This gene, encoded by a genetic locus defined here as lskT, is rearranged and overexpressed in the murine T cell lymphoma LSTRA. Thus alterations in the structure or expression of this protein-tyrosine kinase gene may in some cases mediate neoplastic transformation. In addition, transcription of the normal lskT gene is restricted to cells of lymphoid origin. We infer that the lskT-encoded protein-tyrosine kinase may aid in transducing proliferative or differentiative signals unique to lymphocytes.",1985,72,451,6,0,19,29,25,45,41,45,35,27,27
c0331a05b6369db517bdc8f750f6f07669565733,Comparative study of the sugar concentration in arterial and venous blood during insulin action.,"It has been shown by Cori, Cori and Goltz 1 and by Frank, Nothman and Wagner 2 from the Minkowski Clinic that by comparing the sugar concentration in the femoral artery and femoral vein of rabbits starved for 24 hours, an increased disappearance of sugar from the blood into the muscles can be demonstrated during insulin action. In view of these results it seemed desirable to investigate whether animals receiving glucose plus insulin would not show a stronger intake of sugar by the muscles than animals which received the same amount of glucose but no insulin. As a standard dose 5 gm. glucose per kgm. was given by stomach tube to rabbits previously starved for 48 hours. The insulin was injected intravenously in a dose sufficiently large to prevent a rise in bloodsugar after the glucose ingestion. Blood samples were taken simultaneously from the femoral artery and femoral vein of unanesthetized animals in half hour intervals, 1 to 6 blood samples before the experiment was started and 4 to 8 blood samples after giving either glucose alone or glucose plus insulin. In order to minimize the individual variability of the test animal several comparative experiments, first with sugar alone and then with sugar plus insulin, were performed on subsequent days on the same rabbit. In another group of experiments this was reversed so that first sugar plus insulin and then sugar alone was given to the same rabbit. The data are summarized in Table I. The figures represent the difference in sugar concentration between femoral artery and femoral vein that were observed at the time intervals noted after giving either glucose alone or glucose plus insulin. The figures of each vertical column represent one individual experiment. An average difference between arterial and venous blood sugar for each observation time was calculated from the horizontal columns. It will be noted that the average differences fo'r the series with glucose plus insulin are for all observation times greater than those of the series with glucose alone. This would mean that more sugar disappears from the blood into the muscles in the former series than in the latter, or that rabbits receiving insulin plus glucose show a larger intake of sugar by the muscles than rabbits receiving glucose alone.",1924,0,6,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Previous reports have shown that this receptor interacts with several HLA class-I molecules, as well as with some viral proteins. We have demonstrated that the subset of CD85j + Natural Killer (NK) cells efficiently controls human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) in vitro and this led us to hypothesize that the CD85j + NK cell-mediated anti-HIV activity in MDDC is specifically dependent on the interaction between the CD85j receptor and unknown non-HLA class-I ligand(s).ResultsIn this study, we focused our efforts on the identification of these non-described ligands for CD85j. We found that the CD85j receptor interacts with a calcium-binding proteins of the S100 family; namely, S100A9. We further demonstrated that HIV-1 infection of MDDC induces a modulation of S100A9 expression on surface of the MDDC, which potentially influences the anti-HIV-1 activity of human NK cells through a mechanism involving CD85j ligation. Additionally, we showed that stimulation of NK cells with exogenous S100A9 enhances the control of HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells.ConclusionsOur data show that S100A9 protein, through ligation with CD85j, can stimulate the anti-HIV-1 activity of NK cells.",2013,47,35,1,0,3,4,7,5,2,0,8,5,0

This map was obtained from a third crystal form of hexokinase, called BIII, which exhibits space group P212121 and which contains only one monomer per asymmetric unit. The 51,000 molecular weight monomer has an elongated shape (80 A by 55 A by 50 A) and is divided into two lobes by a deep central cleft. The polypeptide chain is folded into three structural domains, one of which is predominantly alpha-helical and two of which each contain a beta-pleated sheet flanked by alpha-helices. Both glucose and AMP bind to these crystals and produce significant alterations in the protein structure. Glucose binds in the deep cleft, as was observed previously in the BII crystal of the dimeric enzyme. AMP, however, binds to a site that is different from the major intersubunit ATP binding site observed in the crystalline dimer. The AMP is found near one of the beta-pleated sheets. From our current interpretation of this electron density map we conclude that neither of the two nucleotide binding regions has the same structure as has been observed for the nucleotide binding regions of the dehydrogenases, adenylate kinase, and phosphoglycerate kinase, although some similarities exist.",1975,1,51,0,3,5,3,1,1,1,0,2,0,2

Nuclei were transplanted into enucleated eggs which contained [ 32 P]phosphate, and the resulting nuclear transplant-embryos showed a pattern of RNA synthesis which was indistinguishable from that of normal embryos developing from fertilized eggs. Although ribo-somal RNA is actively synthesized by neurula endoderm cells and by swimming tadpole gut cells, no synthesis of ribosomal RNA was detected during the cleavage promoted by nuclei transplanted from these kinds of cells. However, synthesis of ribosomal RNA recommences during gastrulation in nuclear-transplant embryos in the same way as in embryos from fertilized eggs. DNA-like RNA and soluble RNA are synthesized during late cleavage by nuclear-transplant embryos as well as by embryos derived from fertilized eggs. Forty minutes after transplantation, nuclei have undergone a 30-fold increase in volume, reaching the same size as zygote nuclei during this period, and their definitive nucleoli disappear. At gastrulation, definitive nucleoli reappear in the nuclear-transplant embryos.

Spectra Involving Terms Essentially of the Form B(j 2 -σ 2 ),"Properties of rotational terms of the form $B({j}^{2}\ensuremath{-}{\ensuremath{\sigma}}^{2})$.---Evidence is presented to show that the AlH, ${\mathrm{He}}_{2}$, and certain other bands involve rotational terms essentially of the form $B({j}^{2}\ensuremath{-}{\ensuremath{\sigma}}^{2})$, and are in agreement with the postulates of a previous ${\mathrm{paper}.}^{1}$ Since terms of this form have not hitherto been recognized in practice, their chief empirical properties, as shown by the bands discussed below, are now summarized. (1) There are in general two values of the rotational energy term $F(j)$ for each $j$ value. This type of rotational doubling has previously been confused with that which occurs, due to $\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}\ensuremath{\epsilon} (\mathrm{where} \ensuremath{\epsilon}=|\ensuremath{\rho}|)$, when $F(j)$ is essentially of the form $B{(j\ensuremath{-}\ensuremath{\rho})}^{2}$. In the special case where $\ensuremath{\rho}$ and $\ensuremath{\sigma}$ are both zero ($^{1}S$ states), all rotational doubling is absent. (2) The two sets of $F(j)$ values, in doubling of the $\ensuremath{\sigma}$ type, in general differ in respect to the values of $B$ and of a small ""secondary"" $\ensuremath{\rho}$ whose presence must, at least formally, be admitted; thus ${F}_{i}(j)={B}_{i}[{(j\ensuremath{-}{\ensuremath{\rho}}_{i})}^{2}+\ensuremath{\cdots}(i=A or B)$, with $\ensuremath{\epsilon}l\frac{1}{2}$, or usually \ensuremath{\ll}\textonehalf{}, in practice; a slight difference in the electronic term values may also occur (as e.g., in the ${\mathrm{He}}_{2}$ bands). (3) In general, there are six branches in combinations of two $\ensuremath{\sigma}$-type terms (cf. Eqs. (2) of text); in the $P$ and $R$ branches, combinations occur only between like rotational terms (${{F}^{\ensuremath{'}}}_{A}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{{F}^{\ensuremath{'}\ensuremath{'}}}_{A}$, and ${{F}^{\ensuremath{'}}}_{B}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{{F}^{\ensuremath{'}\ensuremath{'}}}_{B}$), while in the $Q$ branches, ""crossing over"" always occurs (${{F}^{\ensuremath{'}}}_{A}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{{F}^{\ensuremath{'}\ensuremath{'}}}_{B}$ or ${{F}^{\ensuremath{'}}}_{B}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{{F}^{\ensuremath{'}\ensuremath{'}}}_{A}$). (4) In the special case of $^{1}P\ensuremath{-}^{1}S$ and $^{1}S\ensuremath{-}^{1}P$ combinations (cf. Eqs. (1) and Fig. 1 of text), there are only three branches, due to the existence for the $^{1}S$ electronic state of only one rotational state for each value of $j$ (these states have the properties of ${F}_{B}$ states); apparent ""combination defects"" in $P\ensuremath{-}Q\ensuremath{-}R$ combinations result here from the $Q$ crossing over phenomenon. (5) In $^{2}S\ensuremath{-}^{2}P$ and $^{2}P\ensuremath{-}^{2}S$ transitions, the intercombination of the $\ensuremath{\rho}$-type $^{2}S$ term with the $\ensuremath{\sigma}$-type $^{2}P_{1}$ or $^{2}P_{2}$ term gives rise to a special band structure (with six branches) in which for a frequent limiting case there is a practically complete coalescence of one of the $P$ with one of the $Q$ branches, and of one of the $R$ branches with the other $Q$ branch (cf. Eqs. (8), (8A), and (8B) of text). The existence of these band-types is strong evidence for the reality of the $\ensuremath{\rho}$ values +\textonehalf{} and -\textonehalf{} for $^{2}S$ states, and so affords additional confirmation of Kratzer's interpretation of the violet CN bands ($^{2}S\ensuremath{-}^{2}S$ transition) as adopted in ref. 1.The CO, AlH, and ${\mathrm{He}}_{2}$ bands.---Assuming $\ensuremath{\rho}=0$, $\ensuremath{\sigma}=1$ for $^{1}P$ states, it was shown in ref. 1 that the structure and missing lines of the CO \AA{}ngstrom bands are in agreement with the classification $^{1}P\ensuremath{-}^{1}S$ given by Birge. The AlH bands are now shown to fall under the classification $^{1}S\ensuremath{-}^{1}P$, and it is predicted that the fourth positive CO bands, designated as $^{1}S\ensuremath{-}^{1}P$ by Birge, will have the corresponding structure and missing lines.---By adopting the assumption (due to Mecke) that alternate lines are missing in each branch, it is shown that the three-branch ""series"" bands of helium are of the $^{1}S\ensuremath{-}^{1}P$ type and the three-branch bands $\ensuremath{\lambda}6400$ and 4546 of the $^{1}P\ensuremath{-}^{1}S$ type, while the six-branch band $\ensuremath{\lambda}5733$ appears as the (only known) representative of the $^{1}P\ensuremath{-}^{1}D$ type. Revised values of various constants of the ${\mathrm{He}}_{2}$ molecule in its different electronic states are given in Table I. To account for the alternate missing lines, a system of alternate suppressed rotational levels (cf. Fig. 2) is assumed. The correctness of this system is supported by several lines of evidence in addition to the satisfactory interpretation of the band structures; e.g., it correctly predicts the absence of $^{1}S\ensuremath{-}^{1}S$ and $^{1}P\ensuremath{-}^{1}P$ transitions in ${\mathrm{He}}_{2}$. The relation of the excited states of ${\mathrm{He}}_{2}$ to those of He is discussed briefly.Resonance series and the band spectra of the alkalies and the halogens. The fluorescent radiation emitted by a molecule after excitation by absorption of monochromatic light consists under suitable conditions of a series (""resonance series"" of Wood) of roughly equidistant groups of band lines, corresponding to a series of final vibrational states. According to the present analysis, various transitions in even molecules should yield resonance series of the following types: $^{1}S\ensuremath{-}^{1}S$, $P\ensuremath{-}R$ doublets; $^{1}P\ensuremath{-}^{1}P$ (or $^{1}D\ensuremath{-}^{1}D$, etc.), $P\ensuremath{-}Q\ensuremath{-}R$ triplets but with the $Q$ member usually too weak to be noticed; $^{1}P\ensuremath{-}^{1}D$, $^{1}D\ensuremath{-}^{1}P$, $^{1}P\ensuremath{-}^{1}S$, etc., $P\ensuremath{-}Q\ensuremath{-}R$ triplets; $^{1}S\ensuremath{-}^{1}P$, doublet series ($P, R$) for some exciting wave-lengths and singlet series ($Q$ only) for others. The visible ${\mathrm{I}}_{2}$ absorption bands give rise to $P\ensuremath{-}R$ doublets (interpreted as such by Lenz), so that they (and by analogy the corresponding ${\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$ and ${\mathrm{Cl}}_{2}$ bands) are probably $^{1}S\ensuremath{-}^{1}S$ (or perhaps $^{1}P\ensuremath{-}^{1}P$ or $^{1}D\ensuremath{-}^{1}D$). The ${\mathrm{Na}}_{2}$ absorption bands in the green, giving both singlet and doublet resonance series, are probably $^{1}S\ensuremath{-}^{1}P$, and the same is probably true by analogy of most of the familiar alkali metal bands. In further support of this, there is no evidence, in the band structure, of electronic doublets such as appear in the atomic transitions $^{2}S\ensuremath{-}^{2}P_{1,2}$. The relation of the electronic states of ${\mathrm{Na}}_{2}$ to those of Na is briefly discussed.Other band spectra.---Although no detailed analyses are available, the evidence indicates that the red CN, $\mathrm{BO}\ensuremath{\alpha}$, and C${\mathrm{O}}^{+}$ comet tail bands (also the doublet alkaline earth halide bands?) have a structure (cf.(5) under ""Properties....,"" above) essentially the same as that of the ZnH, CdH, and HgH bands, and characteristic of the transition $^{2}S\ensuremath{-}^{2}P_{1,2}$. The ""combination"" bands of BO and C${\mathrm{O}}^{+}$ and the NO third positive bands (presumably also Jevons' SnCl bands) probably have a similar structure characteristic of $^{2}P_{1,2}\ensuremath{-}^{2}S$ transitions. Predictions are given for the structure of $^{2}P\ensuremath{-}^{2}D$ bands; these should differ from all bands now on record in having ${T}^{\ensuremath{'}}$ and ${T}^{\ensuremath{'}\ensuremath{'}}$ both integral.---The OH, CH and MgH bands are briefly discussed following Table II, which gives a condensed summary of $T$, $\ensuremath{\rho}$ and $\ensuremath{\sigma}$ values, and electronic transitions, for the band types discussed here and in ref. 1. Table II shows that in all known cases, ${j}_{e}$ appears essentially as $\ensuremath{\sigma}$ in $P$ and $D$ states, but as $\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}\ensuremath{\epsilon}$ in $S$ states (for $^{1}S$ states ${j}_{e}=0$). A corollary is that $m$ is half-integral in known $S$ states, but not in $P$ or $D$ states.",1926,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

A study has been made in single barnacle muscle fibres of the effect of micro‐injected pure protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) on the response of the Na efflux to injection of cyclic AMP and external acidification. 2. (i) Injection into fibres of 1.6 x 10(‐4) M‐pure PKI is without effect on the resting Na efflux. (ii) Injection of 1.6 x 10(4) M‐pure PKI before 0.03 M‐cyclic AMP causes a marked reduction in the magnitude of the response of the Na efflux to the nucleotide. The same is true when 10(‐4) M‐cyclic AMP is injected after PKI. (iii) Injection of partially pure catalytic subunits causes a sustained stimulation of the ouabain‐insensitive Na efflux, which is almost completely reversed by injecting PKI. (iv) Injection of 100 mM‐EGTA before PKI fails to alter the lowered response of the ouabain‐insensitive Na efflux to injection of 10(‐4) M‐cyclic AMP. (v) Ouabain (10(‐4) M) when applied following the injection of 10(‐4) M‐cyclic AMP causes a drastic fall in the stimulated Na efflux. 3. (i) Injection of 1.6 x 10(‐4) M‐pure PKI before or after external acidification fails to abolish or reduce the stimulatory response to acidification. (ii) Injection of 1.6 x 10(‐4) M‐pure PKI before acidification practically abolishes the response of the ouabain‐insensitive Na efflux to 0.03 M‐cyclic AMP in the presence of acidification. (iii) Radioimmunoassay of total cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP content in single fibres before and after acidification shows no appreciable alteration in nucleotide content following acidificiation. (iv) Injection of 100 mM‐EGTA before acidification enhances the stimulatory response to acidification. (v) External application of Dantrolene (10(‐5) M) fails to alter the size of the stimulatory response to acidification. 4. (i) Prior external application of 5 x 10(‐4) M‐benzolamide results in a marked reduction in the magnitude of the response of the ouabain‐insensitive Na efflux to the injection of 3 x 10(‐4) M‐cyclic AMP. (ii) Benzolamide totally abolishes the response of the ouabain‐insensitive Na efflux to the injection of catalytic subunits. 5. The evidence brought forward is compatible with the view that (a) The mechanism by which cyclic AMP stimulates the Na efflux involves activation by cyclic AMP of the cyclic AMP‐dependent protein kinase system, and hence release of the catalytic subunit, and (b) the mechanism by which external acidification leads to stimulation of the Na efflux involves activation of a benzolamide‐sensitive system, possibly carbonic anhydrase, rather than the adenyl cyclase system. The actions of cyclic AMP and catalytic subunits on the Na efflux are closely linked to activation of the benzolamide sensitive system.",1979,30,21,0,0,1,4,3,3,1,2,0,2,0

e2f01c71d3be843ea1dea07b1a7a49d2ead47c11,Diagnostic marker cooperative study for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.,"BACKGROUND
Millions of patients present annually with chest pain, but only 10% to 15% have myocardial infarction. Lack of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of clinical and conventional markers prevents or delays treatment and leads to unnecessary costly admissions. Comparative data are lacking on the new markers, yet using all of them is inappropriate and expensive.


METHODS AND RESULTS
The Diagnostic Marker Cooperative Study was a prospective, multicenter, double-blind study with consecutive enrollment of patients with chest pain presenting to the emergency department. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and frequency of increase in patients with unstable angina were determined for creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) subforms, myoglobin, total CK-MB (activity and mass), and troponin T and I on the basis of frequent serial sampling for </=24 hours. Of 955 patients with chest pain, 119 (12.5%) had infarction identified by use of CK-MB mass, and 203 (21%) had unstable angina. CK-MB subforms were most sensitive and specific (91% and 89%) within 6 hours of onset, followed by myoglobin (78% and 89%). For late diagnosis, total CK-MB activity (derived from subforms) was the most sensitive and specific (96% and 98%) at 10 hours from onset, followed by troponin I (96% and 93%), but not until 18 hours, and troponin T (87% and 93% at 10 hours). In unstable angina, CK-MB subforms were increased in 29.5%, myoglobin in 23.7%, troponin I in 19.7%, and troponin T in 14.8%. All markers were increased in 99 patients. With each marker as the diagnostic standard, CK-MB subforms and myoglobin remained the most sensitive for early diagnosis.


CONCLUSIONS
The CK-MB subform assay alone or in combination with a troponin reliably triages patients with chest pain and should lead to improved therapy and reduced cost.",1999,35,319,7,10,29,24,19,20,25,20,14,25,12

The Crystal Structure of Bixbyite and the C-Modification of the Sesquioxides,"It was discovered in 1925 by Goldschmidt that an extensive series of sesquioxides form cubic crystals with the unit of structure containing 16 M_2O_3, the value of a varying between 9.3 A and 10.9 A. An atomic arrangement based on the space group T^5 was assigned this C-modification of the sesquioxides by Zachariasen, who studied crystals of Sc_2O_3, Mn_2O_3, Y_2O_3, In_2O_3, Tl_2O_3, Sm_2O_3, Eu_2O_3, Gd_2O_3, Tb_2O_3, Dy_2O_3, Ho_2O_3, Er_2O_3, Tm_2O_3, Yb_2O_3, Lu_2O_3, and the mineral bixbyite, (Fe, Mn)_2O_3. Zachariasen’s procedure was the following. Using the data from powder and Laue photographs of Tl_2O_3, and neglecting the contribution of the oxygen atoms to the reflections, he decided that the space group is T^5, with the 32 Tl in 8b with parameter t = 0.25, in 12c with parameter u = 0.021, and in 12c with parameter v = 0.542. These parameter values were assumed to hold for all members of the series. The consideration of intensities of reflection of Sc_2O_3 then was found to indicate the 48 O to be in two groups of 24 in the general position of T^5, with parameters x_1 ~ 1/8, y_1 ~ 1/8, x_1 ~ 3/8 and x_2 ~ 1/8, y_2 ~ 3/8, x_2 ~ 3/8.

Following a combination by Denisyuk of the basic method of wavefront reconstruction with Lippmann’s method of colour photography, such holograms are produced by the interference of an object wave with a coherent reference wave, falling on the emulsion from opposite sides. It is shown, by using the first Born approximation, that such deep holograms have three properties which distinguish them from two-dimensional or ‘plane’ holograms: (1) They have directional selectivity, that is to say the image will appear only if the hologram is illuminated in the reconstruction within a certain angular zone. (2) They have colour selectivity, that is to say they will reflect only within a certain narrow waveband close to the original wavelength. (3) The second wave, which is a disturbance in two-dimensional holograms is as good as completely suppressed. All three are of great practical value. It is shown that holograms which are produced by strongly diffused, wide-angle illumination, and which have a random, noise-like appearance, contain the information in the form of the auto-correlation function of densities or scattering powers between different space-elements in the emulsion.",1968,23,31,0,1,3,0,1,1,2,0,1,1,0

A renormalized nuclear charge, Z∞, is found which renders the dimensionally scaled energy at D→∞ a good approximation to that for D=3 with the actual Z. The renormalized charge is readily evaluated by comparing the HF energy (or any other input approximation) with its D→∞ limit. For atoms with any N or Z, the computations are elementary, requiring little more than solution of a quartic equation. With only HF input in addition to the D→∞ limit, the renormalization procedure yields about 2/3 or more of the correlation energy, for neutral atoms with N=Z=2→86.

Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA encoding C. albicans Aqy1p displayed a coefficient of water permeability (Pf) that was equivalent to the Pf for oocytes injected with the cRNA of S. cerevisiae Aqy1p. In addition, as seen in Saccharomyces for Aqy1p and Aqy2p, deletion of AQY1 in C. albicans resulted in cells that were less sensitive than wild‐type to osmotic shock. In Saccharomyces, aquaporin null cells also have a cell surface that is more hydrophobic. However, unlike Saccharomyces, there was no effect on the cell surface hydrophobicity, flocculation or cell aggregation in aqy1 null C. albicans cells.

This is shown by comparing methyltransferase activities of membrane preparations derived from cells grown on either ergosterol, cholesterol, or the synergistic sterol pair.

Methanol extracts of duodenum at all ages contain a molecular form which is larger than CCK12 and about equal in abundance to CCK8. Acid extracts of rat duodenum contain 3 peaks: one elutes in the region of a previously described precursor form, CCK58: another co-elutes with CCK33 or 39; the third peak appears to be lower in molecular weight and is most prominent in the 2 week rat duodenum. Whether the larger iCCK found in methanol extracts or the smaller form found in acid extracts is derived from a common CCK precursor is yet to be determined.",1984,7,26,0,2,4,2,3,3,1,2,1,2,1

The yield from each species is over 10 barrels of oil/acre/year without genetic or agronomic improvement. In addition to plants, there are trees, such as species of Copaifera in Brazil and other tropical areas, which produce a diesel-like oil upon tapping. Each tree produces approximately 40 liters of hydrocarbon per year, and this material can be used directly by a diesel-powered car.

7ed3e69c5c80075dd36afcf881087590d02e336d,Honing up a genre of amphiphilic bistable [2]rotaxanes for device settings,"In response to molecular electroactive device requirements, a molecular shuttle in the shape of an amphiphilic bistable [2]rotaxane has been designed, synthesized, and characterized. It contains a hydrophobic, tetraarylmethane and a hydrophilic, dendritic stopper and two π-electron-rich stations—a (monopyrrolo)tetrathiafulvalene unit and a 1,5-dioxynaphthalene moiety — on the rod section of its dumbbell component, which can act as recognition sites for the tetracationic cyclophane, cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene), to reside around. In contrast to a previously reported “slow” amphiphilic bistable [2]rotaxane, which has an SMe group attached directly to the (monopyrrolo)tetrathiafulvalene unit, this “new and improved” bistable [2]rotaxane has a much less bulky hydrogen atom attached to the (monopyrrolo)tetrathiafulvalene unit. This seemingly small difference in the substituents on the (monopyrrolo)tetrathiafulvalene unit leads to profound changes when comparing the physical properties of the two bistable [2]rotaxanes. Two hydrophilic semidumbbell compounds, comprising only a (monopyrrolo)tetrathiafulvalene unit, and one hydrophobic semidumbbell compound comprising only a 1,5-dioxynaphthalene moiety on its rod section have also been prepared and used to form their corresponding cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) complexes. The kinetics of the complexation/decomplexation process occurring in these complexes have been investigated, using both absorption and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In addition, these model complexes have been used to investigate the strength of the noncovalent bonding interactions occurring between the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) ring component and the semidumbbell component at different temperatures, allowing the free energies, enthalpies, and entropies for the formation of these complexes to be determined. The outcome of these investigations can be used to explain the fact that the “slow” [2]rotaxane exists as a 1:1 mixture of its two possible translational isomers, whereas the “new and improved” [2]rotaxane exists as a 4:1 mixture in favor of the translational isomer where the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetracation encircles the (monopyrrolo)tetrathiafulvalene unit, and also to explain the thermochromic behavior of the “new and improved” [2]rotaxane. In this amphiphilic bistable [2]rotaxane, shuttling of the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetracation can be driven by both chemical and electrochemical oxidation of the (monopyrrolo)tetrathiafulvalene unit rendering it a good candidate for incorporation into two-terminal molecular switch tunnel junctions.

Mimicry—whereby warning signals in different species evolve to look similar—has long served as a paradigm of convergent evolution. Little is known, however, about the genes that underlie the evolution of mimetic phenotypes or to what extent the same or different genes drive such convergence. Here, we characterize one of the major genes responsible for mimetic wing pattern evolution in Heliconius butterflies. Mapping, gene expression, and population genetic work all identify a single gene, optix, that controls extreme red wing pattern variation across multiple species of Heliconius. Our results show that the cis-regulatory evolution of a single transcription factor can repeatedly drive the convergent evolution of complex color patterns in distantly related species, thus blurring the distinction between convergence and homology.",2011,19,393,11,5,30,33,51,32,39,37,39,43,55
1dadf84fc2f258806360a4b53ec14c377c6b44b0,Sulfhydryl Compounds and Crystalline Urease,"Perlzweig 1 states that both crystalline urease and extracts of jack bean meal give a positive sulfhydryl test with nitroprusside and that the more active preparations give stronger tests than the weaker ones. He estimates one of his samples of jack bean meal to contain the equivalent of 70 mg. of glutathione per 100 gm. and believes the substance in the meal to be glutathione, rather than cysteine, since the material is negative to the Sullivan reaction until after hydrolysis. He suggests that urease activity is due in part to the sulfhydryl compound and that it may be possible to separate a sulfhydryl activator from the urease proper. We have independently observed that urease, prepared from jack bean meal by the Sumner procedure and twice recrystallized from 30% alcohol, produces a moderate amount of red color when treated with nitroprusside, ammonium sulfate and ammonia, and had ascribed this reaction to the presence of sulfhydryl groups attached to the urease molecule. It was recently shown that no co-enzyme for urease is present in the soy bean, or the jack bean. 2 However, in view of the statements of Perlzweig we have undertaken experiments to ascertain the connection between crystalline urease and the sulfhydryl groups. Perlzweig refers to studies of Waldschmidt-Leitz and his students upon the significance of sulfhydryl compounds in enzymatic reactions. 3 Attention should be called to the fact that the claim made by Waldschmidt-Leitz that liver arginase is wholly inactive in the absence of sulfhydryl compounds, while it is active in the presence of hydrogen sulfide, cysteine, or reduced glutathione has been vigorously denied by Edlbacher, Kraus, and Walter, 4 as well as by Klein and Ziese, 5 who claim that arginase is never activated by cysteine or by glutathione, but instead is inhibited.",1933,0,11,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0

Lately, stereoretentive olefin metathesis has garnered much attention as a method for the selective generation of both E- and Z-olefins. Early studies employing ill-defined catalysts showed evidence for retention of the stereochemistry of the starting olefins at low conversion. However, thermodynamic ratios E/Z were reached as the reaction proceeded to equilibrium. Recent studies in olefin metathesis have focused on the synthesis of catalysts that can overcome the inherent thermodynamic preference of an olefin, providing synthetically useful quantities of a kinetically favored olefin isomer. These reports have led to the development of stereoretentive catalysts that not only generate Z-olefins selectively, but also kinetically produce E-olefins, a previously unmet challenge in olefin metathesis. Advancements in stereoretentive olefin metathesis using tungsten, ruthenium, and molybdenum catalysts are presented.",2017,127,44,0,1,9,10,13,11,0,0,0,0,0

To gain insight into how this is accomplished, we prepared mice that coexpressed a transneuronal tracer with only one of about 1,000 different odorant receptors. The tracer travelled from nasal neurons expressing that receptor to the olfactory bulb and then to the olfactory cortex, allowing visualization of cortical neurons that receive input from a particular odorant receptor. These studies revealed a stereotyped sensory map in the olfactory cortex in which signals from a particular receptor are targeted to specific clusters of neurons. Inputs from different receptors overlap spatially and could be combined in single neurons, potentially allowing for an integration of the components of an odorant's combinatorial receptor code. Signals from the same receptor are targeted to multiple olfactory cortical areas, permitting the parallel, and perhaps differential, processing of inputs from a single receptor before delivery to the neocortex and limbic system.",2001,48,178,10,2,21,31,33,25,16,16,8,4,3

Measured nuclear level information and matrix elements are used where available. Unmeasured matrix elements for allowed transitions are assigned as in Paper I. Simple shell model arguments are used to estimate Gamow-Teller sum rules and collective state resonance excitation energies. The discrete state contribution to the rates, dominated by experimental information and the Fermi transitions, determines the nuclear rates in the regime of temperatures and densities characteristic of the hydrostatic phases of presupernova stellar evolution. At the higher temperatures and densities characteristic of the supernova collapse phase, the nuclear rates are dominated by the Fermi and the Gamow-Teller collective resonance contributions. Also included is the important effect of neutron shell closure blocking of electron capture on neutron-rich nuclei. Uncertainties in the rate calculation are discussed.

The transport properties of rare-earth (RE) amorphous alloys only begin to be studied. Some interesting effects have been observed : resistivity minima related to magnetic ordering and characteristic magnetoresistance, resistivity minima of non-magnetic origin in other systems, magnetic contributions to the Hall effect.. . Theoretical models have been proposed but not yet completely tested. We will present the topic in its present raw state. 1.

There is a minimum at T, -15 K while the ordering temperature is about 10 K [2]. The change of resistivity between 1.2 K and the minimum is 1.1 %. Similar minima are observed in Ni3Ho and Ni3Er but the resistivity changes are smaller as the RE spin decreases suggesting an exchange scattering effect. The magnetoresistance (figures 1 and 2) confirms the magnetic origin of the resistivity minimum. There is a positive magnetoresistance at low temperature with a peak in dpldH near the ordering temperature. Well above this temperature the magnetoresistance becomes progressively weaker and takes approxi( T 8)2 where B is close to mately a dependence in the Curie-Weiss tempe>ature 6f the paramagnetic susceptibility.

The interference between waves scattered by the exchange interaction on neighbour magnetic ions contributes to the resistivity if there is some correlation between the spin directions.

3975db95031f05c76f3a3da1b651121e260b6eb1,PHOSPHOLIPID METHYLATION AND MEMBRANE FUNCTION,"Hormones, neurotransmitters, antigens, and many drugs initiate their effects by interacting with receptors on the surfaces of cells. How their specific messages are carried from the receptor through the membrane is a problem of major biological importance. In the past two years, our laboratory has found that methylation of membrane phospholipids plays an important role in the transduction of signals through biomembranes. We have found two enzymes in plasma membranes that methylate phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. S-adenosylmethionine serves as the methyl donor in these reactions. The first enzyme (methyltransferase I ) methylates phosphotidylethanolamine to phosphatidyl N-monomethylethanolamine; this enzyme requires MgZf and has a low K, for S-adenosylmethionine. The second enzyme (methyltransferase 11) converts phosphatidyl N-monomethylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine by two successive methylations. Methyltransferase I1 has a high K , for Sadenosylmethionine and does not require Mg2+. The substrate and products of these enzymes are asymmetrically distributed in erythrocyte membranes. Phosphatidylethanolamine faces the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, while phosphatidylcholine is orientated towards the outer surface. Using normal and inside-out red cell ghosts, we found that the phospholipid transferases were asymmetrically localized in membranes. Like its substrate, methyltransferase I faces the cytoplasmic side and methyltransferase I I , like its product, is located in the external surface of the membrane. As phosphatidylethanolamine is successively methylated on the inner surface of the red cell membrane, the metabolites are rapidly translocated across the membrane. The final product, phosphatydylcholine, is located in the outer surface of the membrane. This flip-flop of phospholipids requires Mg2'--a cation necessary for the first methylation step. The product of methyltransferase I, phosphatidyl N-monomethylethanolamine, decreases membrane viscosity. This, in turn, increases membrane fluidity and lateral mobility of proteins. The elucidation of the enzymatic processes involved in the methylation and translocation of phospholipids in membranes made it possible to study the effect of agonists interacting with surface receptors upon transduction of biological signals through the membrane. The initial studies were carried out on 8-adrenergic receptors present on reticulocyte membranes. When rat reticulocyte ghosts were loaded with 3H-S-adenosylmethionine and then stimulated with the 8-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, there was a considerable increase in the 'H-methylated phospholipids. There was also a rapid translocation of these lipids from the inside to the outside surface of the membrane. The increase in phospholipid methylation by isoproterenol was stereospecific and blocked by the 8-adrenergic agonist propanolol. The increase in phospholipid synthesis by a number of catecholamine agonists showed the same order",1981,4,33,2,0,0,1,0,1,1,4,3,0,2
7ca1e804d192414a215c4eec7bdad38b52ba30d2,RESCUE-ESE identifies candidate exonic splicing enhancers in vertebrate exons,"A typical gene contains two levels of information: a sequence that encodes a particular protein and a host of other signals that are necessary for the correct expression of the transcript. While much attention has been focused on the effects of sequence variation on the amino acid sequence, variations that disrupt gene processing signals can dramatically impact gene function. A variation that disrupts an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), for example, could cause exon skipping which would result in the exclusion of an entire exon from the mRNA transcript. RESCUE-ESE, a computational approach used in conjunction with experimental validation, previously identified 238 candidate ESE hexamers in human genes.

The Radiation Chemistry of Solid n-Hexane at 77°K,"The mechanism of the chemical effects of ionizing radiation on solid straight‐chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as polyethylene was studied by use of n‐hexane. This hydrocarbon was short enough to allow analysis of the cross‐link C12 products and of the hexenes formed. It was thought to be long enough to serve as a legitimate substitute for polyethylene. In any case, the yields of H2, olefines, and cross linkages were very similar in the two systems and we believe the mechanistic implications found here for solid n‐hexane at 77°K should apply even to polyethylene.The results indicate: (a) the active species is the original ion radical produced by the ionizing radiation (Co60 gammas); (b) the ion radical reacts before relaxing to redistribute the positive charge or to isomerize in any way, and the products show that there are three primary ions formed corresponding to the first, second, and third carbon atoms in the chain; (c) the ion radical reacts with nearest neighboring groups to bond and rel...",1963,25,36,0,0,2,2,5,1,0,0,5,0,1

First, quail embryo fibroblasts, placed in stationary phase (G 0 ) by prolonged serum starvation, did not support the efficient synthesis of viral DNA during the first 24–48 hr after infection. Synthesis of viral DNA was impaired according to at least two parameters: the amount of DNA was diminished, particularly the amount of the plus-strand DNA (identical in polarity to the viral genome); and the length of both minus and plus strands was reduced in the stationary cells. In parallel cultures fed with fresh serum, over two thirds of the cells were able to reenter the cell cycle within 24 hr, and viral DNA of normal size was synthesized. Second, density labeling of viral and cellular DNA with BUdR was used to determine whether cellular DNA synthesis was required for integration of viral DNA. In both quail embryo fibroblasts released from G 0 by serum replacement and randomly growing duck embryo fibroblasts, viral DNA was integrated only into cellular DNA replicated during the infection. Our results indicate that serum-starved cells lack a factor (or factors) required for the efficient and complete synthesis of ASV-specific DNA. We have not been able to establish whether such factor(s) are present in growing cells only during S phase. Integration of viral DNA appears to require cellular DNA synthesis; this may be due to a requirement for a factor (or factors) present in adequate concentration only during S phase or to a requirement for the structural changes in cellular DNA that accompany replication.",1977,53,212,2,1,3,6,3,6,4,3,2,4,2

The calculated stability change and the lack of significant structural rearrangement in the folded state due to the mutation are in agreement with experimental studies [Kitamura, S., & Sturtevant, J. M. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 3788-3792; Weaver, L. H., et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 3793-3797]. By use of thermodynamic integration, the contributions of specific interactions to the free energy change are evaluated. It is shown that a number of contributions that stabilize the wild type or the mutant partially cancel in the overall free energy difference; some of these involve the unfolded state. Comparison of the results with conclusions based on structural and thermodynamic data leads to new insights into the origin of the stability difference between wild-type and mutant proteins. Of particular interest is the importance of the contributions of more distant residues, solvent water, and the covalent linkage of the mutated amino acid. Also, the analysis of the interactions of Arg/His 96 with the C-terminal end of a helix (residues 82-90) makes it clear that the nearby carbonyl groups (Tyr 88 and Asp 89) make the dominant contribution, that the amide groups do not contribute significantly, and that the helix-dipole model is inappropriate for this case.",1991,55,133,1,5,6,9,9,5,11,1,10,6,5

The amino acid sequences of these prion proteins show approximately 30% identity with mammalian prion proteins. All three species form the same molecular architecture as mammalian PrPC, with a long, flexibly disordered tail attached to the N-terminal end of a globular domain. The globular domain in chPrP and tPrP contains three alpha-helices, one short 3(10)-helix, and a short antiparallel beta-sheet. In xlPrP, the globular domain includes three alpha-helices and a somewhat longer beta-sheet than in the other species. The spatial arrangement of these regular secondary structures coincides closely with that of the globular domain in mammalian prion proteins. Based on the low sequence identity to mammalian PrPs, comparison of chPrP, tPrP, and xlPrP with mammalian PrPC structures is used to identify a set of essential amino acid positions for the preservation of the same PrPC fold in birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals.

The resulting mixture of isomers (AlpM) competes for occupancy of beta-adrenergic receptors in frog erythrocycte membranes with an apparent K D of 210 pM. The bromoacetylated derivative of AlpM (BrAlpM) leads to an irreversible inactivation of the [ 3 H]dihydroalprenolol ([ 3 H]DHA) binding sites. Various adrenergic agonists and antagonists afford specific and stereoselective protection of the receptor against inactivation by BrAlpM. Tritiation of AlpM followed by bromoacetylation and chromatographic separation yielded two isomers, Br-1-AlpM and Br-8-AlpM of high specific radioactivity (∼ 40 Ci/mmol). Both radiolabelled isomers interacted specifically and with high affinity with the beta-adrenergic receptor, but only a small amount of the ligands could be covalently incorporated into the receptor subunit.

460f0e3e730175f52df965cc54f50061955d3e7f,Detection of HIV-1 RNA by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification combined with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.,"Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) has proved to be an ultrasensitive method for HIV-1 diagnosis in plasma even in the primary HIV infection stage. This technique was combined with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) which enables online detection of the HIV-1 RNA molecules amplified by NASBA. A fluorescently labeled DNA probe at nanomolar concentration was introduced into the NASBA reaction mixture and hybridizing to a distinct sequence of the amplified RNA molecule. The specific hybridization and extension of this probe during amplification reaction, resulting in an increase of its diffusion time, was monitored online by FCS. As a consequence, after having reached a critical concentration of 0.1-1 nM (threshold for unaided FCS detection), the number of amplified RNA molecules in the further course of reaction could be determined. Evaluation of the hybridization/extension kinetics allowed an estimation of the initial HIV-1 RNA concentration that was present at the beginning of amplification. The value of initial HIV-1 RNA number enables discrimination between positive and false-positive samples (caused for instance by carryover contamination)-this possibility of discrimination is an essential necessity for all diagnostic methods using amplification systems (PCR as well as NASBA). Quantitation of HIV-1 RNA in plasma by combination of NASBA with FCS may also be useful in assessing the efficacy of anti-HIV agents, especially in the early infection stage when standard ELISA antibody tests often display negative results.",1996,32,72,4,1,2,2,3,7,8,3,4,4,3

Ornithine is the principal precursor for production of polyamines, which are required for cell proliferation. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) contain constitutive arginase I, and arginase inhibitors cause inhibition of cell proliferation. The objective of this study was to determine whether the elevated expression of arginase I in RASMC causes increased cell proliferation. RASMC were stably transfected with either rat arginase I cDNA or a β-galactosidase control expression plasmid. Western blots and arginase enzymatic assays revealed high-level expression of cytosolic arginase I in arginase I-transfected RASMC. Moreover, this observation was associated with the increased production of urea and polyamines and higher rates of RASMC proliferation. The two selective inhibitors of arginase, NG-hydroxy-l-arginine and S-(2-boronoethyl)-l-cysteine, inhibited arginase and decreased the production of urea and polyamines in arginase I-transfected RASMC, all of which were associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation. This study demonstrates that elevated arginase I expression increases RASMC proliferation by mechanisms involving increased production of polyamines. These observations suggest that arginase I plays a potentially important role in controlling RASMC proliferation.",2001,18,150,2,0,8,12,13,6,6,9,14,14,10

Receptor interaction in the regulation of enzyme synthesis and degradation,"Rat adrenal gland dopamine beta-hydroxylase is under neuronal regulation from the splanchnic nerve and hormonal control via adrenal cortical glucocorticoids. The regulatory systems act in different ways; neuronal stimuli induce dopamine beta-hydroxylase synthesis while hormonal stimulation inhibits enzyme degradation. Despite these mechanistic differences, both systems require a normally innervated cholinergic receptor to exert their effect. The enzyme response to either neural stimulation or ACTH administration is blocked by splanchnic denervation. Glucocorticoid stimulation of dopamine beta-hydroxylase, however, can occur after adrenal denervation, suggesting that ACTH acts on a receptor which requires splanchnic innervation, but glucocorticoids act distal to the receptor. Similar results were obtained when the effect of these manipulations were studied on phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, another enzyme in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. A model attempting to unify these and earlier findings is presented, in which the splanchnic nerve is involved in regulating both adrenal cortical glucocorticoidogenesis (by allowing ACTH to act on glucocorticoid synthesis) and adrenal medullary catecholamine biosynthesis (by induction of enzyme synthesis.).",1976,20,38,0,0,3,3,6,2,3,1,3,4,2

Consistent with eutherian-specific function, EEmiRC is expressed in trophoblastic stem (TS) cells.

The pom1 gene, encoding a member of the Dyrk family of protein kinases, has been identified through a mutant showing abnormal cellular morphogenesis. Here we show that Pom1p kinase activity is cell cycle regulated in correlation with the state of cellular symmetry: the activity is high during symmetrical growth and division, but lower when cells grow at just one end. Point mutations in the catalytic domain lead to asymmetry during both cell growth and division, whilst cells overexpressing Pom1p form additional growing ends. Manipulations of kinase activity indicate a negative role for Pom1p in microtubule growth at cell ends. Pom1p is present in a large protein complex and requires its non‐catalytic domain to localize to the cell periphery and its kinase activity to localize to cell ends. These data establish that Pom1p kinase activity plays an important role in generating cellular symmetry and suggest that there may be related roles of homologous protein kinases ubiquitously present in all eukaryotes.",2001,49,109,11,2,4,5,5,7,7,6,6,9,9

CTL clone 3 F9 of BALB/c origin is specific for H‐2Db and can be grown by weekly restimulation with irradiated stimulator spleen cells expressing H‐2Db in the presence of interleukin 2. Two mAb against T cell clone 3F9, 44‐22‐l(IgG2a) and 46‐6 B5(IgM), have been proven to be clone specific: they inhibit cytotoxic activity of 3F9 only and bind specifically to 3 F9 when compared in a panel of different CTL clones, or cells from different mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), BALB/c thymus and spleen cells.

During the final larval stage, an upregulation of the let-7 microRNA indirectly activates the terminal differentiation factor and central regulator of the larval-to-adult transition, LIN-29, via the downregulation of the let-7 target genes lin-41 and hbl-1. Here, we identify a new heterochronic gene, mab-10, and show that mab-10 encodes a NAB (NGFI-A-binding protein) transcriptional co-factor. MAB-10 acts with LIN-29 to control the expression of genes required to regulate a subset of differentiation events during the larval-to-adult transition, and we show that the NAB-interaction domain of LIN-29 is conserved in Kruppel-family EGR (early growth response) proteins. In mammals, EGR proteins control the differentiation of multiple cell lineages, and EGR-1 acts with NAB proteins to initiate menarche by regulating the transcription of the luteinizing hormone β subunit. Genome-wide association studies of humans and various studies of mouse recently have implicated the mammalian homologs of the C. elegans heterochronic gene lin-28 in regulating cellular differentiation and the timing of menarche. Our work suggests that human homologs of multiple C. elegans heterochronic genes might act in an evolutionarily conserved pathway to promote cellular differentiation and the onset of puberty.",2011,77,41,6,0,0,2,7,3,8,3,5,4,4
97dc6e6aba4cf8dc1aec6690c85298a29be8d9df,Prehistory of the Higgs boson,"A Higgs boson is a particle whose existence is predicted in a class of quantum field theories in which a symmetry under a Lie group of transformations of the fields is spontaneously broken by an asymmetric vacuum state. It is a quantum of certain excitations of the order parameter. Such spontaneous symmetry breaking was first proposed as a feature of theories of elementary particles in 1960, but it has a much longer history in the context of condensed matter theory. The earliest relevant example is ferromagnetism, as explained by Heisenberg [1] in 1928; an array of electron spins with nearest-neighbour interactions which favour energetically parallel over antiparallel configurations has a ground state in which all the spins are aligned in some direction, thus breaking the rotational symmetry of the dynamics. Another example, which comes closer to the kind of symmetry breaking which is of interest in particle physics, is superfluidity. In 1947 Bogoliubov [2] studied Bose condensation of an infinite system of neutral spinless bosons with short-range repulsive two-body interactions. Such a condensate is characterised by a ‘macroscopic wave function’ (the order parameter) which is complex; its modulus squared is a measure of the observable condensate density, but its argument (which is unobservable) is arbitrary, thus breaking the symmetry of the dynamics under rotations of the boson wave functions in the Argand diagram. The short-range interactions are represented in the second-quantised Hamiltonian by a term proportional to the square of the particle density, that is, to a quartic in the components of the scalar quantum field. A third example, which became the model for theories in particle physics, is superconductivity. In 1950, Ginzburg and Landau [3] showed that the phenomenon could be understood as a consequence of Bose condensation of electrically-charged spinless bosons: at the time there seemed to be no candidates for such bosons among the known constituents of a metal or alloy. It was only after Cooper had shown how pairs of electrons could bind to form spinless composite bosons that the theory of superconductivity, in the form proposed by Bardeen, Cooper and Schriefer [4] in 1957, became viable. The Ginzburg–Landau theory thereby acquired the status of an effective theory, valid in circumstances where the compositeness of the Cooper pair could be neglected. In common with superfluidity, the macroscopic wave function of the condensate responsible for superconductivity breaks the symmetry of the dynamics under rotations in the Argand diagram, but now, because the bosons are charged, this symmetry is the one which generalises to the gauge invariance of electrodynamics. The BCS energy gap in the fermion spectrum is proportional to the modulus of the condensate wave function; the existence of excitations in which this quantity is no longer constant but has a wavelike space-time dependence was first extracted from BCS theory by Littlewood and Varma [5] in 1981, as the explanation of a puzzling feature of the Raman spectrum of superconducting NbSe2, measured the previous year by Sooryakumar and Klein [6].",2007,33,15,0,0,0,0,2,5,1,2,1,0,1

91a9aca153f6e7bf6822f23729fe696b78d2431d,Cold-sensitive mutants of p34dc2 that suppress a mitotic catastrophe phenotype in fission yeast,"SummaryThe p34cdc2 protein kinase plays a central role in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle, being required both in late G1 for the commitment to S-phase and in late G2 for the initiation of mitosis. p34cdc2 also determines the precise timing of entry into mitosis in fission yeast, where a number of gene produts that regulate p34cdc2 activity have been identified and characterised. To investigate further the mitotic role of p34cdc2 in this organism we have isolated new cold-sensitive p34cdc2 mutants. These are defective only in their G2 function and are extragenic suppressors of the lethal premature entry into mitosis brought about by mutating the mitotic inhibitor p107wee1 and overproducing the mitotic activator p80cdc25. One of the mutant proteins p34cdc2-E8 is only functional in the absence of p107wee1, and all the mutant strains have reduced histone H1 kinase activity in vitro. Each mutant allele has been cloned and sequenced, and the lesions responsible for the cold-sensitive phenotypes identified. All the mutations were found to map to regions that are conserved between the fission yeast p34cdc2 and functional homologues from higher eukaryotes.",1992,48,24,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

6272841b75324d6a74cbb3617e813231ad55af61,C. elegans MCM-4 is a general DNA replication and checkpoint component with an epidermis-specific requirement for growth and viability.,"DNA replication and its connection to M phase restraint are studied extensively at the level of single cells but rarely in the context of a developing animal. C. elegans lin-6 mutants lack DNA synthesis in postembryonic somatic cell lineages, while entry into mitosis continues. These mutants grow slowly and either die during larval development or develop into sterile adults. We found that lin-6 corresponds to mcm-4 and encodes an evolutionarily conserved component of the MCM2-7 pre-RC and replicative helicase complex. The MCM-4 protein is expressed in all dividing cells during embryonic and postembryonic development and associates with chromatin in late anaphase. Induction of cell cycle entry and differentiation continues in developing mcm-4 larvae, even in cells that went through abortive division. In contrast to somatic cells in mcm-4 mutants, the gonad continues DNA replication and cell division until late larval development. Expression of MCM-4 in the epidermis (also known as hypodermis) is sufficient to rescue the growth retardation and lethality of mcm-4 mutants. While the somatic gonad and germline show substantial ability to cope with lack of zygotic mcm-4 function, mcm-4 is specifically required in the epidermis for growth and survival of the whole organism. Thus, C. elegans mcm-4 has conserved functions in DNA replication and replication checkpoint control but also shows unexpected tissue-specific requirements.",2010,66,29,1,0,2,4,1,1,6,0,3,2,4

Involvement of G protein-coupled receptor kinases and cAMP-dependent protein kinase.,"Persistent stimulation of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor (beta 1AR) engenders, within minutes, diminished responsiveness of the beta 1 AR/adenylyl cyclase signal transduction system. This desensitization remains incompletely defined mechanistically, however. We therefore tested the hypothesis that agonist-induced desensitization of the beta 1AR (like that of the related beta 2AR) involves phosphorylation of the receptor itself, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK1) or other G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Both Chinese hamster fibroblast and 293 cells demonstrate receptor-specific desensitization of the beta 1 AR within 3-5 min. Both cell types also express beta ARK1 and the associated inhibitory proteins beta-arrestin-1 and beta-arrestin-2, as assessed by immunoblotting. Agonist-induced beta 1AR desensitization in 293 cells correlates with a 2 +/- 0.3-fold increase in phosphorylation of the beta 1AR, determined by immunoprecipitation of the beta 1AR from cells metabolically labeled with 32P(i). This agonist-induced beta 1AR phosphorylation derives approximately equally from PKA and GRK activity, as judged by intact cell studies with kinase inhibitors or dominant negative beta ARK1 (K220R) mutant overexpression. Desensitization, likewise, is reduced by only approximately 50% when PKA is inhibited in the intact cells. Overexpression of rhodopsin kinase, beta ARK1, beta ARK2, or GRK5 significantly increases agonist-induced beta 1AR phosphorylation and concomitantly decreases agonist-stimulated cellular cAMP production (p < 0.05). Furthermore, purified beta ARK1, beta ARK2, and GRK5 all demonstrate agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the beta 1AR. Consistent with a GRK mechanism, receptor-specific desensitization of the beta 1AR was enhanced by overexpression of beta-arrestin-1 and -2 in transfected 293 cells. We conclude that rapid agonist-induced desensitization of the beta 1AR involves phosphorylation of the receptor by both PKA and at least beta ARK1 in intact cells. Like the beta 2AR, the beta 1AR appears to bind either beta-arrestin-1 or beta-arrestin-2 and to react with rhodopsin kinase, beta ARK1, beta ARK2, and GRK5.",1995,45,324,7,0,16,29,31,35,25,18,17,13,18

The coated pits are discrete segments of the plasma membrane that can undergo rapid imagination to form coated endocytic vesicles. In one form of the human genetic disorder familial hypercholesterolaemia, the responsible mutation produces altered lipoprotein receptors that lack the ability to become incorporated into coated pits. Instead, these mutant receptors are scattered at random over the entire plasma membrane. Because of their mislocation on the cell surface, the mutant lipoprotein receptors are unable to carry their bound lipoprotein into the cell. The occurrence of this ‘receptor mislocation mutation’ provides strong evidence for the role of the coated pit in the receptor-mediated uptake of lipoproteins. The data also have implications for the structure and assembly of plasma membranes in mammalian cells.",1977,24,236,3,0,6,15,15,15,15,15,6,22,10

These particles may contain the visual pigment, porphyropsin. Counts of the micelles, and microspectrophotometric measurements of porphyropsin in the retina and single rods yield the estimate that each lamellar micelle may contain about 50 molecules of porphyropsin. (b) Systems of about 30 cytoplasmic filaments (here called dendrites), continuous with the cytoplasm of the inner segment, and standing like a palisade about the outer segments of the rods and cones. In the rods, one such filament stands in the mouth of each of the approximately 30 deep fissures that carve the outer segment into a radial array of lobules. (c) A system of deeply staining particles in the membranes of the dendrites, and another in the membranes of the pigment epithelial processes. It is suggested that these may have a part in interchanges of material with the outer segments. The ciliary process is found to penetrate more deeply than is commonly supposed into the outer segments of the rods and cones. The edge of each double-membrane disc in rods forms a differentiated rim structure, both around the disc circumference and bordering the fissures. These anatomical arrangements are summarized in Figs. 13 and 14, and the relevant measurements in Table I. The dilution of visual pigment in Necturus rods and cones and a general consideration of their microstructures make it seem unlikely that such typically solid state processes as exciton migration or photoconduction can transport the effects of light far from the site of absorption. Excitation must, therefore, be conveyed to the receptor as a whole by some axial structure. Among axial structures, the plasma membrane is most likely to be the site of nervous excitation. The ciliary process probably plays its main role in the embryogenesis and regeneration of outer segments; and the dendrites and pigment epithelial processes in exchanges of material with the outer segments and perhaps with one another.",1963,63,164,2,0,3,6,4,4,4,6,4,5,5

Cap formation induced by anti-immunoglobulin was always found to be opposite to the point of attachment. The movements and the shape changes were prevented by cytochalasin B and colchicine. Treatment with these agents did not prevent cap formation but led to randomization of the position of the caps with respect to the fiber. Exposure to concanavalin A or attachment of cells to concanavalin A fibers prevented both movement and patch and cap formation, suggesting that cellular structures regulating the mobility of various receptors are altered by binding to concanavalin A fibers.

In the presence of fluoride, the conversion of fructose to glucose is inhibited, and an acid-labile phosphate ester accumulates. Isolation and characterization by its strong negative specific rotation, hydrolysis constant in acid, and liberation of inorganic phosphate on forming the osazone, identified this ester as funcoose-1-phosphate. Another acid-labile phosphate ester which accumulated even in the absence of a phosphate acceptor was isolated as the crystalline sodium salt and identified as inorganic pyrophosphate. 
 
A protein fraction precipitated from liver extract between 0.45 and 0.55 saturation with ammonium sulfate catalyzed the conversion of fructose-1-phosphate to hexose-6-phosphate. This mutase reaction was accelerated by Mg++ ions and inhibited by fluoride. In liver homogenate, in the absence of fluoride, the mutase reaction is followed by dephosphorylation of hexose-6-phosphate to free glucose and inorganic phosphate. These three enzymatic reactions explain the mechanism of conversion of fructose to glucose in the liver. 
 
The formation of fructose-1-phosphate by liver fructokinase is not inhibited by glucose, in contrast to the strong inhibition glucose exerts on the phosphorylation of fructose by yeast and brain hexokinase. Fructose utilization in the liver is thus independent of glucose utilization, the latter being catalyzed by a separate enzyme. The liver fructokinase is much more active in an aerobic system with catalytic amounts of ATP than in an anaerobic system with an excess of ATP.

The cause is unknown, but it could be related to the period of uterine 'rest' which may restore full function to the steroid-sensitive systems, such as the pinopodes, after a prolonged period of constant menstrual cycling. This may result in the restoration of uterine capacity for embryo implantation to levels typical of younger women. Some other avenues of research on the unusual aspects of human implantation are worth further study. An impaired uterine blood flow could lower the chances of implantation. Immunological factors may emerge as major elements in the human implantation process, because the neutralization of antiphospholipid antibodies may enhance the activity of early trophoblast.",1995,0,119,3,0,1,2,11,4,3,0,5,12,4

b6c4cd20ca0dd85582d0f386328c040a830a35d4,Constitutional adaptation of dynamic polymers: hydrophobically driven sequence selection in dynamic covalent polyacylhydrazones.,"The folding and assembly of linear biological macromolecules into specific supramolecular architectures on the basis of their primary sequences embodies the flow of structural information from the molecular level to larger scales through the iterative application of reversible (dynamic) supramolecular forces. Understanding and controlling such up-scale propagation of structural information offers the potential to impose precise order (and attendant function) at the nanoand mesoscopic levels. The processing of structural information by interactional algorithms is a central theme of constitutional dynamic chemistry (CDC), which embodies the use of reversible covalent or noncovalent interconnections to build up higherorder dynamic entities of molecular or supramolecular nature from molecular subunits. In recent years, the implementation of CDC in polymer science has led to the development of dynamic polymers, or dynamers, which are generated from monomers joined by either supramolecular or reversible covalent interconnections. By virtue of their capacity to undergo monomer incorporation, exchange, and reorganization processes, dynamers are especially attractive as stimulusresponsive materials. Variation in dynamer constitution through component selection has been shown to occur in response to various external triggers, as well as in selforganization-driven selection in gel formation. A less developed aspect of dynamer chemistry is the possibility it offers of interrogating structural relationships within macromolecules. In the strictly hierarchical folding of conventional, constitutionally static polymers, a fixed monomer sequence determines the folded structure. In contrast, an appropriately designed dynamer may exhibit an interdependence between primary and secondary structure, through which sequences that adopt well-defined folded structures may spontaneously assemble by selection of the appropriate components under the pressure of folding stabilization as an internal driving force. This scenario is particularly intriguing in view of postulates that protein folding (analog information) has driven the adaptation of primary sequences (digital information) on an evolutionary timescale. The prospect of using folding energies to select for the expression of certain dynamer sequences is also highly attractive from the standpoints of nanosynthesis and materials chemistry. In pursuit of folding-driven sequence selection, we sought to develop dynamers with well-defined secondary structures. Previous studies have established that folding can enhance the stabilities of reversibly linked macromolecules while giving rise to nucleation–growth (N–G) behavior. In view of the importance of hydrophobicity in biomacromolecular folding, we designed amphiphilic dialdehyde (DA; CA and BA) and di(acylhydrazine) (DH; CH and BH) monomers consisting of a lipophilic core (a substituted carbazole (C) or benzene (B)) and a hydrophilic hexaglyme (HG) chain (Scheme 1). The reversible, acid-catalyzed polycondensation of a given DA/DH pair would be expected to generate a polyacylhydrazone dynamer, presenting a nonpolar main chain from which hydrophilic HG moieties emanate at regular intervals. It was envisioned that such local amphiphilicity would promote the hydrophobically driven formation of recurrent folded structures, which may preferentially accommodate certain monomer sequences on the basis of both their structural fit and their interactions within the folded superstructure. The four possible polymers poly(CA-CH), poly(BA-BH), poly(CA-BH), and poly(BA-CH) were synthesized by acid-",2009,29,55,0,0,7,5,10,8,6,1,7,3,3

To evaluate postgrafting prophylaxis for graft‐versus‐host disease (GVHD), the patients were entered into a randomized prospective trial comparing a combination of methotrexate and cyclosporin (n= 22) to methotrexate alone (n= 24). Methotrexate/cyclosporin significantly reduced the incidence and severity of acute GVHD and improved early survival. This report updates the results of the randomized trial with follow‐up ranging from 3 to more than 6 years. The methotrexate/cyclosporin regimen did not interfere with sustained engraftment, and there were no significant differences in the incidence of early or late graft rejection among the two treatment groups (10%v 4%). The incidence of chronic GVHD was higher among methotrexate/cyclosporin‐treated patients (58%v 36%; P=0·18). Two patients in each treatment group still require treatment for chronic GVHD, while treatment is no longer needed in the other patients. Projected 4‐year survival is 73% in patients given methotrexate/cyclosporin compared to 58% in patients given methotrexate alone (P=0·16). Having achieved a reduction in the incidence of acute GVHD and associated early mortality without impairing engraftment, it is clear that future progress in marrow grafting for aplastic anaemia must come in the area of chronic GVHD.",1989,14,105,0,0,7,3,9,2,4,4,3,1,2

Starting with a strain which was probably hybrid, although of unknown ancestry, and selecting during thirteen generations for a larger extent of colored coat (""plus"" selection), they sueceeded in obtaining animals with a greater and greater area of pigmentation. The average, the mode, and the extremes were raised. Conversely, selection for less pigmentation ('""minus'"" selection) was accompanied by a gradual but decided and continual dimunition in the dark area. "" Return "" selection also succeeded; that is, plus selection was effective ven in a line which was already lighter than the average on account of a previous minus selection, and, vice versa, minus selection caused a lightening of a strain that had been made exceptionally dark by a prior plus selection. Certain crosses proved that more than one factor affecting hoodedness is involved in the difference between the different races. Therefore the production of animals of desired grade by selection may perhaps be explained as a mere sorting out, into different lines of descent, of different combinations of the various factors for hoodedness originally present in the heterozygous ancestors. It is the opinion of Castle and Phillips, however, that this explanation will not suffice to account fully for the continued efficacy of selection in their experiments, and they believe it probable that a factor or factors for hoodedness are undergoing variation of a fluctuating nature.",1914,0,21,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

Because most GPI-anchored proteins are associated with cholesterol-rich membranous microdomains, we asked whether such structures participate in the metabolism of PrPC or the formation of PrPSc. The initial degradation of PrPC involves removal of the NH2 terminus of PrPC to produce a 17-kD polypeptide which was found in a Triton X-100 insoluble fraction. Both the formation of PrPSc and the initial degradation of PrPC were diminished by lovastatin-mediated depletion of cellular cholesterol but were insensitive to NH4Cl. Further degradation of the 17-kD polypeptide did occur within an NH4Cl-sensitive, acidic compartment. Replacing the GPI addition signal with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse CD4 rendered chimeric CD4PrPC soluble in cold Triton X-100. Both CD4PrPC and truncated PrPC without the GPI addition signal (Rogers, M., F. Yehieley, M. Scott, and S. B. Prusiner. 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 90:3182-3186) were poor substrates for PrPSc formation. Thus, it seems likely that both the initial degradation of PrPC to the 17-kD polypeptide and the formation of PrPSc occur within a non-acidic compartment bound by cholesterol-rich membranes, possibly glycolipid-rich microdomains, where the metabolic fate of PrPC is determined. The pathway remains to be identified by which the 17-kD polypeptide and PrPSc are transported to an acidic compartment, presumably endosomes, where the 17-kD polypeptide is hydrolyzed and limited proteolysis of PrPSc produces PrP 27-30.",1995,79,453,25,1,0,1,0,2,5,10,6,5,4

The time scale is set by the decay constant for tritium-12.5 years half life and 18.0 years average life. We expect therefore that whereas freshly fallen rain or snow will show a definite radioactivity due to tritium, old water will show none, and that the age of the water in the sense of the time elasped since precipitation may be determinable from the specific radioactivity. Further, agricultural products should be datable by the tritium content of their constituent hydrogen, the principle being that a considerable fraction of the hydrogen utilized in plant growth originates as rain water and is incorporated in the first few months after precipitation. The time of harvest therefore is close to the time of precipitation. Consequently, it seems possible that the age of agricultural products in the practical sense of the time elapsed since harvest probably can be measured by determination of the tritium content of the product itself. A series of tests is in progress in our laboratory using water of known age and wines of known vintage to test these postulates. B. Hydrology and the Identification of Water Sources.-A second type of application occurs in the identification of water sources. The mean storage time of rain or snow water before it appears in a given water supply should be given directly by the tritium content of the given supply relative to that of average rain in the region involved. The determination of mean storage times of between about three and twenty-five years should prove possible, these times corresponding to between 15 and 75% loss of tritium due to radioactive decay. The determination of tritium in wells should reveal whether their ultimate supplies are closely connected to the rainfall and therefore are subject to seasonal fluctuations in rainfall.",1953,0,28,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0

ea866386c5530f7ad0671ff341560b1c404f0f1c,From diyls to ylides to my idyll.,"Chemical research and mountaineering have much in common. If the goal or the summit is to be reached, both initiative and determination as well as perseverance are required. But after the hard work it is a great joy to be at the goal or the peak with its splendid panorama. However, especially in chemical research as far as new territory is concerned the results may sometimes be quite different: they may be disappointing or delightful. Looking back at my work in scientific research, I will confine this talk to the positive results (1). Some 50 years ago I was fascinated by an idea which I investigated experimentally. The question was how ring strain acts on a ring if an accumulation of phenyl groups at two neighboring carbon atoms weakens the C-C linkage and predisposes to the formation of a diradical (for brevity called diyl) (Fig. 1). Among the many experimental results (2) I choose the synthesis of the hydrocarbons 1 and 4 (3), which we thought capable of diyl formation. Starting materials were appropriate dicarboxylic esters, which we transformed into the corresponding glycols. While these were obtained under the influence of phenylmagnesium halide only in modest yield, phenyllithium proved to be superior and was readily accessible by the method of K. Ziegler, using bromobenzene and lithium. The glycolates resulting from the reaction with potassium phenylisopropylide formed on heating with methyl iodide the corresponding dimethyl ethers, which supplied the equivalent hydrocarbons 1 and 4 by alkali metal splitting and demetalation with tetramethylethylene dibromide.",1980,15,64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
091627aedc55cdebf5764c45d3814af19323c4e7,The multiple organ dysfunction syndrome caused by endotoxin in the rat: attenuation of liver dysfunction by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase,"1 We have investigated whether (i) endotoxaemia caused by E. coli lipopolysaccharide in the anaesthetized rat causes a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS; e.g. circulatory failure, renal failure, liver failure), and (ii) an enhanced formation of nitric oxide (NO) due to induction of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) contributes to the MODS. In addition, this study elucidates the beneficial and adverse effects of aminoethyl‐isothiourea (AE‐ITU), a relatively selective inhibitor of iNOS activity, and NG‐methyl‐l‐arginine (l‐NMMA), a non‐selective inhibitor of NOS activity on the MODS caused by endotoxaemia. 2 In the anaesthetized rat, LPS caused a fall in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) from 117±3mmHg (time 0) to 97±4mmHg at 2 h (P<0.05, n=15) and 84±4mmHg at 6 h (P < 0.05, n= 15). The pressor effect of noradrenaline (NA, 1 μg kg−1, i.v.) was also significantly reduced at 1 to 6 h after LPS (vascular hyporeactivity). Treatment of LPS‐rats with AE‐ITU (1 mg kg−1, i.v. plus 1 mg kg−1 h−1 starting at 2 h after LPS) caused only a transient rise in MAP, but significantly attenuated the delayed vascular hyporeactivity seen in LPS‐rats. Infusion of l‐NMMA (3 mg kg−1, i.v. plus 3 mg kg−1 h−1) caused a rapid and sustained rise in MAP and attenuated the delayed vascular hyporeactivity to NA. Neither AE‐ITU nor l‐NMMA had any effect on either MAP or the pressor effect elicited by NA in rats infused with saline rather than LPS. 3 Endotoxaemia for 6 h was associated with a significant rise in the serum levels of aspartate or alanine aminotransferase (i.e. GOT or GPT), γ‐glutamyl‐transferase (γGT), and bilirubin, and hence, fiver dysfunction. Treatment of LPS‐rats with AE‐ITU significantly attenuated this liver dysfunction (rise in GOT, GPT, yGT and bilirubin) (P <0.05, n=10). In contrast, l‐NMMA reduced the increase in the serum levels of γGT and bilirubin, but not in GOT and GPT (n = 5). Injection of LPS also caused a time‐dependent, but rapid (almost maximal at 2 h), increase in the serum levels of urea and creatinine, and hence, renal dysfunction. This renal dysfunction was not affected by either AE‐ITU (n= 10) or l‐NMMA (n= 5). In rats infused with saline rather than LPS, neither AE‐ITU (n = 4) nor l‐NMMA (n = 4) had any significant effect on the serum levels of GOT* GPT, yGT, bilirubin, creatinine or urea. 4 Endotoxaemia for 6 h resulted in a 4.5 fold rise in the serum levels of nitrite (9.13 ±0.77 μm, P < 0.01, n= 15), which was significantly reduced by treatment with AE‐ITU (6.32±0.48 μm, P <0.05, n=10) or l‐NMMA (5.10±0.40 μm, P < 0.05, n = 5). In addition, endotoxaemia for 6 h was also associated with a significant increase in iNOS activity in lung and liver homogenates, which was significantly reduced in lung or liver homogenates obtained from LPS‐rats treated with either AE‐ITU or l‐NMMA. 5 Thus, AE‐ITU or l‐NMMA (i) inhibits iNOS activity in LPS‐rats without causing a significant increase in MAP in rats infused with saline and, hence inhibition of endothelial NOS activity, and (ii) attenuates the delayed circulatory failure as well as the liver dysfunction caused by endotoxaemia in the rat. Thus, an enhanced formation of NO may contribute to the development of fiver failure in endotoxic shock.",1995,35,223,1,1,6,16,17,19,20,17,15,11,15

The first methyltransferase converted PE to phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine (PME) and the second methyltransferase converted PME to PC. Previous work has shown that increased PME synthesis decreases membrane microviscosity. Therefore, changes in the rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450, phospholipid methyltransferases and membrane microviscosity after induction by phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene were studied. Phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene increased cytochrome P-450 levels 2- to 3-fold. At low SAM concentration, the proportion of PME among the total phospholipids formed increased significantly, and at a high SAM concentration, the proportion of PC among the total phospholipids formed decreased significantly in microsomes of treated rats. Treatment of rats with phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene also decreased microviscosities of the microsomal membranes and liposomes which were prepared from phospholipids extracted from the microsomes. In synthetic liposomes containing PE, PME and PC, microviscosity decreased when the proportion of PME was increased or the proportion of PC was decreased. These results suggest that the membrane fluidity increases with phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene treatment, and changes in phospholipid methyltransferases may contribute to the process of enzyme induction. During induction with phenobarbital, all three factors known to increase membrane fluidity (linoleic acid content, the formation of phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine, and decreases in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio) contribute to the decrease in microviscosity. During induction with 3-methylcholanthrene, alterations in phospholipid methylation is possibly the primary cause of the decrease in membrane microviscosity.",1981,0,31,1,0,1,3,5,2,1,6,1,1,1

Positive influence of trivalent doping (Lu, Gd, Y) was noted, which consists in suppressing the deeper trapping states in the PbWO4 structure. Such states are related to the radiative recombination processes in the green and red part of the spectra. The presence of the green emission centers also results in the increase of the slow recombination decay components in the microsecond time scale.

We examined the requirement for telomerase activity for the generation of these G-strand overhangs in mammalian cells. Using non-denaturing in-gel hybridization to both tissue and cultured cells from mice deficient for the telomerase RNA component, we found that G-strand overhangs exist in the absence of telomerase activity. Quantitation of overhang signal intensity showed no significant reduction in telomerase-deficient cells relative to wild-type.

For the temperature dependence a cross-over between a two-dimensional (2D) (higher temperatures) and 3D (lower temperatures) behavior is obtained. In the 3D limit the relative correction is isotropic. In the 2D limit it is extremely anisotropic having a logarithmic dependence in the ab plane, and a power law for the c conductivity. The interaction correction to the density of states is calculated as a function of temperature. A criterion for the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior differs strongly from the interference correction, and makes the 2D limit unlikely. In the 3D limit this correction is proportional to (sq root)(T). Comparison between corrections of different origins favors the interference logarithmic correction for the in-plane conductivity, in agreement with experiment. The c-axis correction can be of either origin, and is nonlogarithmic, as observed in some experiments. The dependence of the relative correction on magnetic field in the 3D limit is always proportional to (sq root)(H), in agreement with experiment, and the coefficient depends only on the orientation of the magnetic field.more » (c) 2000 The American Physical Society.« less",2000,0,13,0,2,4,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Performance reached hyperacuity levels within the first five trials for the non-stereo stimuli. For stereoacuity tasks the results were very different. Even extremely experienced observers with very low thresholds for certain stereo tasks required considerable practice to achieve their best performance for slightly different stereo tasks. Performance on both types of tasks showed considerable observer variability. These results suggest that adults do not synthesize new visual modules for hyperacuity tasks early in the visual pathway on a task-driven basis. We also interpret these results to suggest that there can be many equally general models of hyperacuity performance that show only the qualitative general trends of a ""standard"" observer.

The method depends on the fact that ammonium carbamate is stable in Nessler solution so that one-half of the nitrogen in the ammonium carbamate does not affect the color of the Nessler solution. However, if the solution is acidified before Nesslerizing, the carbamic acid is almost instantly decomposed and Nesslerization gives the total of ammonia and carbamate nitrogen present. In other particulars analyses are made according to the well-known colorimetric method of determining ammonia. Each solution to be analyzed was Nesslerized under these 2 different conditions. The difference between the two values for nitrogen was equal to the carbamic acid nitrogen. Twice this figure was equal to the ammonium carbamate nitrogen. The method was shown to be quantitative within the limits of accuracy of reading a colorimeter. A number of experiments have been carried out in which the enzyme was allowed to act on 100 cc. ice-cold 1% urea. The action was stopped after 5 to 7 minutes by adding a trace of potassio-mercuric iodide. During this time about 1 mg. per cc. of total combined nitrogen had been liberated from the urea. This concentration was found to be most convenient for analysis. After poisoning the enzyme, analyses were made immediately for ammonium carbamate and ammonium carbonate and then at intervals until the carbamate had fallen almost to zero. Figure 1 shows the curve for percentage ammonium carbamate nitrogen of the total nitrogen when plotted against time after the enzyme had been stopped. The percentage of carbamate diminished very rapidly but at a measurable rate. Our method of analysis was not accurate enough to determine the point of equilibrium between the carbonate and the carbamate.",1930,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7b8b8a895d05d23d8e02e56ba81217d8214f4000,Ekiden to iPS Cells,"When I started a long ekiden—a relay marathon by multiple runners—toward cellular reprogramming about a decade ago, not many teams joined the start of the race. At the time, many laboratories were trying to differentiate embryonic stem (ES) cells into various functional cells, inspired by the report on the isolation of human ES cells1. In contrast, I tried to dedifferentiate somatic cells back to the embryonic state. I was not sure if we could reach our goal in my lifetime, but thanks to diligent colleagues and students in my laboratory (Fig. 1), luck favored us. In August 2006, we announced the generation of ES cell–like stem cells by introducing four transcription factors—Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc—into mouse fibroblasts by retroviral vectors2. I named this new type of cells ‘induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells’. We reported the generation of human iPS cells3 on 20 November 2007, the same day that James Thomson and his colleagues also announced their success in making human iPS cells4. With the ability to differentiate into virtually all types of cells and to grow robustly like ES cells, iPS cells have enormous potential for pharmaceutical and clinical applications5,6. The technology is expected to be used for generating disease models, drug screening, toxicology and regenerative medicine, circumventing two obstacles surrounding ES cells—the ethical controversy over destruction of embryos to isolate ES cells and the risks of immune rejection when ES-derived cells are transplanted into a person. In vitro uses of iPS cells are just around the corner, but there are still many hurdles before their clinical application. However, I believe that strenuous efforts of researchers around the world will make the promises a reality in the not-too-distant future. Today, iPS cell research has become one of the hottest areas in the life sciences, with an increasing number of laboratories worldwide working on the technology. Many new findings have been reported in the short time since the first report was published5,7. I cannot stress enough that without the many studies using mouse and human ES cells that have appeared since the isolation of mouse ES cells in 1981 (refs. 8,9), we would not have been able to generate iPS cells and advance the field at such rapid speed. In fact, my encounter with mouse ES cells led me to start the ekiden toward iPS cell generation.",2009,26,21,1,0,4,2,1,1,3,2,2,2,1

A large body of literature focuses on the different catalytic forms of XOR and their importance in the synthesis of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, which are involved in many disease processes. More recently, various protective physiological roles of XOR have been recognized. We summarize for the first time that XOR is a component of the innate immune system. Because XOR is involved in multiple features of innate immunity we suggest that it is central to the evolution and function of this ancient defense system. We present evidence suggesting that XOR is a direct downstream target of the evolutionarily conserved Toll-like receptor–NF-κB pathway and discuss that numerous forms of post-translational modification of XOR could provide intrinsic molecular switches that make XOR an ideal component of various fast innate immune responses.",2003,94,188,8,3,6,6,7,7,10,11,9,7,20
2d3ef982ec11d9d3349297b4a6ecdb62405cf18f,Analysis of mRNA synthesis following induction of the Escherichia coli SOS system.,"Escherichia coli responds to impairment of DNA synthesis by inducing a system of DNA repair known as the SOS response. Specific genes are derepressed through proteolytic cleavage of their repressor, the lexA gene product. Cleavage in vivo requires functional RecA protein in a role not yet understood. We used mRNA hybridization techniques to follow the rapid changes that occur with induction in cells with mutations in the recA operator or in the repressor cleavage site. These mutations allowed us to uncouple the induction of RecA protein synthesis from its role in inducing the other SOS functions. Following induction with ultraviolet light, we observed increased rates of mRNA synthesis from five SOS genes within five minutes, maximum expression ten to 20 minutes later and then a later decline to near the initial rates. The presence of a recA operator mutation did not significantly influence these kinetics, whereas induction was fully blocked by an additional mutation in the repressor cleavage site. These experiments are consistent with activation of RecA protein preceding repressor cleavage and derepression of SOS genes. The results also suggest that the timing and extent of induction of individual SOS genes may be different.",1984,20,29,1,0,2,1,6,2,2,1,1,3,1

To investigate the mechanisms involved, we treated male nude mice bearing xenografts of DU-145 human androgen-independent prostate cancer with Cetrorelix at a dose of 100 microg/animal subcutaneously (s.c.) once a day. Tumor growth, serum and tumor levels of IGF-I and -II as well as the mRNA expression of IGF-I and -II in tumors were evaluated. After 8 weeks of treatment, final volume and weight of DU-145 tumors in mice treated with Cetrorelix were significantly decreased compared with controls and serum IGF-1 showed a significant reduction. Therapy with Cetrorelix also reduced by 84% the levels of IGF-II in DU-145 tumor tissue compared with controls, but did not affect the concentration of IGF-I. RT-PCR analyses revealed a high expression of mRNA for IGF-II, but not for IGF-I in DU-145 tumors. Treatment with Cetrorelix decreased the expression of IGF-II mRNA by 78% (p < 0.01) as compared with controls. Our study indicates that LH-RH antagonist Cetrorelix may inhibit the growth of DU- 145 human androgen-independent prostate cancers by decreasing the production and mRNA expression of IGF-II by the tumor tissue. This also suggests that LH-RH antagonist Cetrorelix could interfere with the signal transduction pathways involving IGF-II, leading to tumor growth inhibition.",1998,43,41,1,0,2,4,5,3,6,3,0,0,3

Liu et al. determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of an intact class I transcription activation complex. The positions and orientations of all the components and the detailed protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions reveal how an activator interacts with the promoter DNA and recruits RNA polymerase through the class I mechanism. Together with a recently reported class II transcription activation complex, the findings complete our structural understanding of bacterial transcription activation. Science, this issue p. 947 The cryo–electron microscopy structure of a bacterial transcription activation complex reveals how transcription is initiated. In bacteria, the activation of gene transcription at many promoters is simple and only involves a single activator. The cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate receptor protein (CAP), a classic activator, is able to activate transcription independently through two different mechanisms. Understanding the class I mechanism requires an intact transcription activation complex (TAC) structure at a high resolution. Here we report a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of an intact Escherichia coli class I TAC containing a CAP dimer, a σ70–RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme, a complete class I CAP-dependent promoter DNA, and a de novo synthesized RNA oligonucleotide.

Mathematical Treatment of Reversible Electron Transfer with Alternating Voltage Control and Distorted Current,"A mathematical treatment is developed which yields equations relating faradaic current, voltage, and time when an alternating voltage is applied to an electrolytic cell composed of a plane and auxiliary electrodes immersed in a solution containing initially supporting electrolyte and only reversibly oxidizable or reducible species. Both oxidant and reductant are taken to be soluble, and specific adsorption is assumed to be absent. The voltage across that branch of the equivalent circuit through which only faradaic current flows is assumed to be periodic with fixed amplitude and with or without an additional direct applied voltage component; the resultant current is distorted. Diffusion controlled kinetics is postulated, and it is assumed that equilibrium is essentially established at the electrode surface. The equations developed show that a “steady state” (i.e., a periodic state) is quickly attained, yield diagnostic tests of use in establishing the reversible mechanism, make it possible to determine the standard potential, and finally yield for the periodic state a relation between faradaic current and time. These results are then generalized so as to include systems in which the reversible electrochemical step is followed by a sufficiently slow secondary reaction step. One diagnostic result of interest in the latter connection is that the mean faradaic current vanishes in the periodic state, regardless of the amplitude or of the shape of the applied periodic potential, when the follow‐up reaction occurs to a negligible extent.",1950,2,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The high and low current levels of those gates were separated by factors of 15 and 30, respectively, which is a significant enhancement over that expected for wired-logic gates.",1999,17,1206,13,4,50,63,83,87,88,88,111,74,84

Previous experiments have shown that these animals do not mount a transgene‐specific IgG response upon stimulation with purified VSV‐G or infection with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing VSV‐G. However, infection of VSV‐G transgenic animals with wild‐type vesicular stomatitis virus, serotype Indiana, readily induced VSV‐G‐specific, neutralizing IgG autoantibodies. We have tested whether this labile state of tolerance reflected differential availability of VSV‐G‐specific T help. For this, we immunized transgenic mice with the self‐antigen VSV‐G covalently coupled to sperm‐whale myoglobulin (VSV‐G‐SWM), to provide new T helper epitopes that are linked to the B cell epitope; co‐injected uncoupled VSV‐G and SWM served as control. High titers of VSV‐G specific IgG autoantibodies were detected in serum of mice immunized with VSV‐G‐SWM but not after co‐injection of uncoupled VSV‐G and SWM. Transgenic animals depleted of CD4+ T cells prior to injection of VSV‐G‐SWM failed to mount an IgG response. Priming of transgenic mice with the foreign carrier did not accelerate the IgG autoantibody response to VSV‐G‐SWM, suggesting that B cells were limiting the rate of the response. Thus, self‐reactive B cells could be triggered to produce IgG, if they received linked T help specific for a foreign carrier determinant provided either by a classical carrier determinant or a virus.",1994,23,38,1,1,2,2,5,4,2,7,2,4,1

In the ([ital e],[mu])+[nu]+jets channel we search for [ital b] quarks from [ital t] decays via secondary vertex identification and via semileptonic decays of the [ital b] and cascade [ital c] quarks. In the dilepton final states we find two events with a background of 0.56[sub [minus]0.13][sup +0.25] events.

An important breakthrough occurred when the self-organised growth approach had been refined to such an extent, that defect-free QDs made with these technique exhibited properties predicted for zero-dimensional structures. Their practical application in devices, first of all lasers, became possible. When used for active layers in injection lasers differential gain is strongly increased potentially providing improved dynamic properties. The cut-off frequencies larger than 10 GHz are presently demonstrated. The saturation material gain is as high as 15 x 10 4 cm -1 as compared to QW values of about 3 x 10 3 cm -1 , The wavelength dependence of gain is best described by Master equations of microstates. High internal (>96%) and differential (70%) efficiencies at 300 K and output power up to 4 W are realized now for QD lasers emitting in the 0.94-1.15 μm range.

b6b8c3975df84d0f2a4d5d6f18c40d5360418bc2,Useful Information from Axial Peak Magnetization in Projected NMR Experiments,"Axial peaks arise from magnetization which is not frequencylabeled in at least one indirect dimension of a multidimensional NMR1 experiment.2 Because they correspond to incomplete coherence transfers, axial peaks represent a considerable magnetization reservoir. Here we show that the previously introduced projection technique3,4 allows the derivation of useful information from axial coherences. In these experiments3-15 the evolution of chemical shifts in the projected dimension gives rise to cosine modulation of the transfer amplitude, which leads to peak doublets encoding n + 1 chemical shifts in an n-dimensional spectrum. Axial single-quantum coherences which are frequency-labeled in all indirect dimensions except the projected one can be observed as peaks located at the center of the doublets. Simultaneous acquisition of projected and central peaks facilitates the symmetrization of the spectrum6,9,16 and the unambiguous assignment of multiple peak doublets with degenerate chemical shifts in the other dimensions.6,15 NMR experiments delineating exclusively scalar connectivities are either “out-and-stay” experiments, in which excitation and detection is on different nuclei, or “out-and-back” schemes, in which the magnetization is detected on the same proton which was initially excited (Figure 1).17 Moreover, the one-bond scalar coupling topology of the spins correlated in different indirect dimensions of out-and-back experiments (S, K, and L in Figure 1) may be bifurcated or linear. For “bifurcated out-and-back” 3D HS experiments, where underlined letters denote nuclei observed in a common dimension4 and the enclosed spins represent the two branches, recording of central peaks can be achieved as recently described for 3D HNN .6 After magnetization transfer from H to S, JSK and JSL at the branching point (Figure 1a) evolve simultaneously, and the spin with the larger coupling to S is detected in quadrature. The product operator terms SxKzLz and SyKz give rise to doublets and central peaks, respectively, which have opposite sign (see Figure 4 in ref 6). In the corresponding 4D experiment, the term SyKz would give rise to noninformative axial peaks. Most triple-resonance pulse schemes designed for proteins17 represent linear “out-and-back” experiments. In 3D HSKL (Figure 1b), JSK and JKL evolve during sequential transfer steps. Hence, central peaks have to come from magnetization which has been transferred to K, but not to L. With HSQC-type magnetization transfer and K detected in quadrature, the doublets and central peaks arise from the product operator terms SzKzLy and SzKy, respectively with peak patterns as in 3D HS (see supporting information). The transfer amplitudes of doublets and central peaks are proportional to sin(πJKLτ) and cos(πJKLτ), respectively, where τ is the duration of the transfer delay. Considering JKL only, all three peaks have the same intensity if cos(πJKLτ°) ) 0.5 sin(πJKLτ°) at τ° ) 0.61/ (2JKL). τ° is close to the transfer maximum when rapid T2relaxation and/or additional passive couplings prevent a complete transfer.

The catalysts were characterized by conventional and microprobe Raman spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, analytical electron microscopy and temperature-programmed decomposition. The chemisorption of carbon monoxide was studied by transmission infrared spectroscopy. The results indicate a very strong interaction of K+ ions with the catalyst surface. The original octahedral coordination of Mo6+ in the NiMo Al 2 O 3 catalyst is transformed into a tetrahedral coordination and the reducibility of Mo6+ is strongly decreased in the presence of K+ ions. Also the degree of sulfidation seems to be reduced in KNiMo Al 2 O 3 , this phenomenon being accompanied by a stabilization of the Mo5+ oxidation state. CO chemisorption leads to the formation of carbonates and formates on both catalysts in their oxidized and sulfided states. On reduced KNiMo Al 2 O 3 CO polymer anions also seem to be formed. The effect of K+ ions on the catalytic performance of the NiMo Al 2 O 3 catalysts was tested for thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS), ethylene hydrogenation, CO methanation, and water gas shift (WGS). A significant reduction in activity was observed for HDS in the presence of K+ ions, while the activity for WGS was simultaneously enhanced. An attempt is made to correlate the changes of the catalytic performance with the changes which are induced by K2CO3 impregnation on structure, symmetry, and valence state of the molybdenum species.",1984,16,69,0,0,2,2,2,5,6,0,3,1,0

Here we present a simple method for generating conditional mutations based on the use of a protein-destabilizing genetic element in combination with systems allowing the induction and repression of gene expression. This genetic cassette can be fused to other protein-coding sequences, and once transcription is turned off and synthesis of the gene product ceases, the preexisting protein is rapidly degraded. We have applied this method to the analysis of the yeast ARD1 gene product, a subunit of an N-terminal acetyltransferase, and show that a complete loss of ARD1 product can be achieved in less than one generation. Despite the rapid loss of ARD1 protein, there is a prolonged delay in the expression of the ard1 mutant phenotype, suggesting that the acetylated substrates of ARD1 are metabolically stable and/or exert a long-lasting effect on processes such as the repression of the silent mating type cassettes.",1992,0,60,3,1,1,4,2,2,2,6,1,3,2

While these reactions take place spontaneously, they rarely proceed at a rate fast enough for life. Enzymes, biological catalysts found in all cells, greatly accelerate the rates of these chemical reactions and impart on them extraordinary specificity. In 1926, James B. Summer crystallized the enzyme urease and found that it was a protein. Skeptics argued that the enzymatic activity might reside in a trace component of the preparation rather than in the protein (Haldane, 1930), and it took another decade for the generality of Sumner's finding to be established. As more and more examples of protein enzymes were found, it began to appear that b~iological catalysis would be exclusively the realm of proteins. In 1981 and 1982, my research group and I found a case in which RNA, a form of genetic material, was able to cleave and rejoin its own nucleotide linkages. This self-splicing RNA provided the first example of a catalytic active site formed of ribonucleic acid. This lecture gives a personal view of the events that led to our realization of RNA self-splicing and the catalytic potential of RNA. It provides yet another illustration of the circuitous path by which scientific inquiry often proceeds.

The diagnosis of HCC is usually made in the late stages of the disease, when treatment options are limited and prognosis is poor. We therefore have developed a method of glycoproteomic analysis in an attempt to discover serum markers that can assist in the early detection of HBV-induced liver cancer. Briefly, a comparative method for analysis of oligosaccharides released from serum glycoproteins and for recovery and identification of proteins with aberrant glycosylation, as a function of cancer diagnosis, is described. The model we have used is the woodchuck (Marmota monax), which shares similarities in the glycosylation pattern associated with liver proteins in human HCC. In this report, we show that woodchucks diagnosed with HCC have dramatically higher levels of serum-associated core alpha-1,6-linked fucose, as compared with woodchucks without a diagnosis of HCC. The coupling of this methodology with 2D gel proteomics has permitted the identification of several glycoproteins with altered glycosylation as a function of cancer. One such glycoprotein, Golgi Protein 73 (GP73), was found to be elevated and hyperfucosylated in animals with HCC. Further, the study showed GP73 to be elevated in the serum of people with a diagnosis of HCC, providing a validation of our approach. The potential of this technology for biomarker discovery and the implications of increased levels of GP73 in liver cancer are discussed.",2005,42,326,8,5,20,26,18,31,26,28,20,16,21

The A2AR is also a target for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, where A2AR antagonists have been shown to enhance signaling through the D2 dopamine receptor. Here we present the crystal structure of the A2AR bound to a novel bitopic antagonist. As a result of structural changes needed to accommodate the bound antagonist, crystals could not be grown in lipidic cubic phase. Instead, crystals were grown in detergent with a type II packing rarely observed in GPCR crystals. The structure revealed a potential allosteric pocket that that can be exploited to develop subtype-selective allosteric modulators. The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) has long been implicated in cardiovascular disorders. As more selective A2AR ligands are being identified, its roles in other disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, are starting to emerge, and A2AR antagonists are important drug candidates for nondopaminergic anti-Parkinson treatment. Here we report the crystal structure of A2A receptor bound to compound 1 (Cmpd-1), a novel A2AR/N-methyl d-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B) dual antagonist and potential anti-Parkinson candidate compound, at 3.5 Å resolution. The A2A receptor with a cytochrome b562-RIL (BRIL) fusion (A2AR–BRIL) in the intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) was crystallized in detergent micelles using vapor-phase diffusion. Whereas A2AR–BRIL bound to the antagonist ZM241385 has previously been crystallized in lipidic cubic phase (LCP), structural differences in the Cmpd-1–bound A2AR–BRIL prevented formation of the lattice observed with the ZM241385–bound receptor. The crystals grew with a type II crystal lattice in contrast to the typical type I packing seen from membrane protein structures crystallized in LCP. Cmpd-1 binds in a position that overlaps with the native ligand adenosine, but its methoxyphenyl group extends to an exosite not previously observed in other A2AR structures. Structural analysis revealed that Cmpd-1 binding results in the unique conformations of two tyrosine residues, Tyr91.35 and Tyr2717.36, which are critical for the formation of the exosite. The structure reveals insights into antagonist binding that are not observed in other A2AR structures, highlighting flexibility in the binding pocket that may facilitate the development of A2AR-selective compounds for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.",2017,35,87,5,8,27,26,15,11,0,0,0,0,0

The work function initially decreases until at γ = 0.2 the lifting of the reconstruction begins. A comparison with Pt(100) and Pt(111) shows that the similar behaviour of CO-induced work function changes on all three low-index planes of Pt appears to be related with a similar binding geometry of CO adsorbed on top of a (quasi-)hexagonal configuration of Pt atoms. No hysteresis is observed in the adsorption/desorption equilibrium of CO on Pt(110). Although the energetics of the CO-induced phase transition on Pt(110) appear to be analogous to those of the phase transition 1 × 1 ⇹ hex of Pt(100), a number of differences exist between the two surfaces which can be explained by the different structural properties of the various surface phases involved.",1988,12,43,0,0,1,6,5,3,2,1,1,1,0

Methods: Tumors included adult high-grade gliomas (D-54 MG, D-245 MG), childhood high-grade gliomas (D-212 MG, D-456 MG), medulloblastomas (D-341 MED, D-487 MED), ependymomas (D-612 EP, D-528 EP), and a mismatch repair-deficient procarbazine-resistant glioma [D-245 MG (PR)]. Tumors were grown subcutaneously in athymic nude mice and vinorelbine was administered at a dose of 11 mg/kg on days 1, 5, and 9. Additionally, vinorelbine was also administered in combination with BCNU against D-54 MG. Results: Vinorelbine produced statistically significant growth delays in D-456 MG, D-245 MG, and D-245 MG (PR). No statistically significant growth delays were observed in D-54 MG, D-487 MED, D-212 MG, D-528 EP, D-341 MED or D-612 EP. The antitumor effects of the vinorelbine/BCNU combination were additive. Growth delays observed in the procarbazine-resistant line [D-245 MG (PR)] were greater than twofold the delays seen in the parent line (D-245 MG). Vincristine was equally potent against D-245 MG and D-245 MG (PR). Taxol demonstrated little activity against D-245 MG but produced 32- and 18-day growth delays in D245 MG (PR).

7126af0d64f49845fef2764c962cbb03b850142e,Place cells in the hippocampus: Eleven maps for eleven rooms,"Significance The hippocampus is thought to store a large number of experiences that, despite their similarity, can be individually retrieved with minimal interference. Studies have shown that place cells in hippocampal area CA3 form statistically independent representations of pairs of environments. It has remained unclear, however, whether CA3 place cells maintain this independence when the number of environments is increased. We recorded activity from CA3 in 11 environments with nearly identical geometric features. Spatial firing patterns remained uncorrelated across all 55 pairs of environments, with minimal overlap in the populations of active cells. The data suggest that the capacity of the CA3 network is large and speak against extensive recurrence of spatial motifs across experiences. The contribution of hippocampal circuits to high-capacity episodic memory is often attributed to the large number of orthogonal activity patterns that may be stored in these networks. Evidence for high-capacity storage in the hippocampus is missing, however. When animals are tested in pairs of environments, different combinations of place cells are recruited, consistent with the notion of independent representations. However, the extent to which representations remain independent across larger numbers of environments has not been determined. To investigate whether spatial firing patterns recur when animals are exposed to multiple environments, we tested rats in 11 recording boxes, each in a different room, allowing for 55 comparisons of place maps in each animal. In each environment, activity was recorded from neuronal ensembles in hippocampal area CA3, with an average of 30 active cells per animal. Representations were highly correlated between repeated tests in the same room but remained orthogonal across all combinations of different rooms, with minimal overlap in the active cell samples from each environment. A low proportion of cells had activity in many rooms but the firing locations of these cells were completely uncorrelated. Taken together, the results suggest that the number of independent spatial representations stored in hippocampal area CA3 is large, with minimal recurrence of spatial firing patterns across environments.",2014,38,155,6,0,13,19,23,26,29,21,23,0,0

POS-1 is one of several CCCH zinc-finger RNA-binding proteins that regulate cell fate specification during C. elegans embryogenesis. Paradoxically, pos-1 mutants exhibit striking defects in endo-mesoderm development but have wild-type distributions of SKN-1, a key determinant of endo-mesoderm fates. RNAi screens for pos-1 suppressors identified genes encoding the cytoplasmic poly(A)-polymerase homolog GLD-2, the Bicaudal-C homolog GLD-3, and the protein NEG-1. We show that NEG-1 localizes in anterior nuclei, where it negatively regulates endo-mesoderm fates. In posterior cells, POS-1 binds the neg-1 3' UTR to oppose GLD-2 and GLD-3 activities that promote NEG-1 expression and cytoplasmic lengthening of the neg-1 mRNA poly(A) tail.

As a result, much data are now available regarding the anatomy and physiology of many neural structures involved in such processes. On the basis of this growing body of knowledge, we have recently built a computer model that incorporates detailed replicas of several important neural structures participating in the production of orienting behavior. In order to expose this model to sensorimotor and environmental conditions similar to those experienced by a barn owl, the computer simulations of the neural structures were coupled to a robot emulating the head of a barn owl, which was presented with auditory and visual stimulation. By using this system we have performed a number of studies on the mechanisms underlying the barn owl’s calibration of orienting behavior and accurate localization of auditory targets in noisy environments. In this paper we review the main results that have emerged from this line of research. This work provides a concrete example of how, by coupling computer simulations of brain structures with robotic systems, it is possible to gain a better understanding of the basic principles of biological systems while producing robust and flexible control of robots operating in the real world.",2000,31,24,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,4,0,3

The recombinants are therefore spi- and may be separated from the spi+ vector phages by plating on strains lysogenic for bacteriophage P2. Random fragments suitable for insertion into lambda 1059 are obtained by partial digestion of high molecular weight eukaryotic DNA with Sau3a. This restriction enzyme cleaves at the sequence G-A-T-C and leaves a 5'-tetranucleotide ""sticky end.""

The Tetrahymena telomerase ribonucleoprotein uses an internal RNA template to catalyse d(TTGGGG)n telomere addition to the 3′ end of telomeric sequence in vitro and in vivo 10,11. Studies of telomerase RNA indicated that hybridization of the RNA template region, 5′-CAACCCCAA-3′, to the 3′ end of single-stranded telomeric oligonucleotides might be important for primer recognition and utilization10. The apparent requirement of telomerase for pre-existing telomeric sequence has raised questions regarding its role in chromosome healing12,13. We report here that Tetrahymena telomerase can specifically elongate single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides whose termini are not complementary to the RNA template sequence 5′-CAACCCCAA-3′.

However, the central role, multiple isoforms, and complex target interactions of calmodulin make it difficult to examine its precise functions. Here, we analyzed calmodulin function in neurons using lentivirally delivered short-hairpin RNAs that suppressed expression of all calmodulin isoforms by ∼70%. Calmodulin knockdown did not significantly alter neuronal survival or synapse formation but depressed spontaneous neuronal network activity. Strikingly, calmodulin knockdown decreased the presynaptic release probability almost twofold, without altering the presynaptic readily-releasable vesicle pool or postsynaptic neurotransmitter reception. In calmodulin knockdown neurons, presynaptic release was restored to wild-type levels by expression of constitutively active calmodulin-dependent kinase-IIα (CaMKIIα); in contrast, in control neurons, expression of constitutively active CaMKIIα had no effect on presynaptic release. Viewed together, these data suggest that calmodulin performs a major function in boosting synaptic strength via direct activation of presynaptic calmodulin-dependent kinase II.",2010,72,104,4,6,11,11,13,7,12,6,11,10,4

Hereditary forms, such as cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), may provide insights into key molecular mechanisms and pathways. The serine protease HtrA1, whose activity is impaired in CARASIL, has been proposed to attenuate TGF-β signaling leading to increased pathway activity in diseased arteries. We analyzed HtrA1-deficient mouse brain tissue and mouse and CARASIL patient fibroblasts and found a reduction in signaling activity on various pathway levels suggesting a facilitating role of HtrA1. Moreover, we identified LTBP-1 as a novel HtrA1 substrate and provide evidence for its functional modulation by HtrA1-dependent proteolysis. Our data suggest down-regulation of TGF-β signaling as a key mechanism underlying CARASIL pathogenesis. High temperature requirement protein A1 (HtrA1) is a primarily secreted serine protease involved in a variety of cellular processes including transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling. Loss of its activity causes cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), an inherited form of cerebral small vessel disease leading to early-onset stroke and premature dementia. Dysregulated TGF-β signaling is considered to promote CARASIL pathogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we present evidence from mouse brain tissue and embryonic fibroblasts as well as patient skin fibroblasts for a facilitating role of HtrA1 in TGF-β pathway activation. We identify latent TGF-β binding protein 1 (LTBP-1), an extracellular matrix protein and key regulator of TGF-β bioavailability, as a novel HtrA1 target. Cleavage occurs at physiological protease concentrations, is prevented under HtrA1-deficient conditions as well as by CARASIL mutations and disrupts both LTBP-1 binding to fibronectin and its incorporation into the extracellular matrix. Hence, our data suggest an attenuation of TGF-β signaling caused by a lack of HtrA1-mediated LTBP-1 processing as mechanism underlying CARASIL pathogenesis.",2014,47,80,7,0,5,8,16,14,13,11,13,0,0

Five-period InGaN/GaN MQWs with different magnesium doping levels were grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. The AFM measurements indicated that magnesium doping led to a smoother surface morphology. The V-defect density was observed to decrease with increasing magnesium doping concentration from ∼109 cm−2 (no doping) to ∼106 cm−2 (Cp2Mg: 0.04 sccm) and further to 0 (Cp2 Mg: 0.2 sccm). The PL measurements showed that magnesium doping resulted in stronger emission, which can be attributed to the screening of the polarization-induced band bending. XRD revealed that magnesium doping had no measurable effect on the indium composition and growth rate of the MQWs.

259356d43b8f47d3e2580e013f0a1be059ccc93e,MDGAs interact selectively with neuroligin-2 but not other neuroligins to regulate inhibitory synapse development,"The MAM domain-containing GPI anchor proteins MDGA1 and MDGA2 are Ig superfamily adhesion molecules composed of six IG domains, a fibronectin III domain, a MAM domain, and a GPI anchor. MDGAs contribute to the radial migration and positioning of a subset of cortical neurons during early neural development. However, MDGAs continue to be expressed in postnatal brain, and their functions during postnatal neural development remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that MDGAs specifically and with a nanomolar affinity bind to neuroligin-2, a cell-adhesion molecule of inhibitory synapses, but do not bind detectably to neuroligin-1 or neuroligin-3. We observed no cell adhesion between cells expressing neuroligin-2 and MDGA1, suggesting a cis interaction. Importantly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of MDGAs increased the abundance of inhibitory but not excitatory synapses in a neuroligin-2–dependent manner. Conversely, overexpression of MDGA1 decreased the numbers of functional inhibitory synapses. Likewise, coexpression of both MDGA1 and neuroligin-2 reduced the synaptogenic capacity of neuroligin-2 in an artificial synapse-formation assay by abolishing the ability of neuroligin-2 to form an adhesion complex with neurexins. Taken together, our data suggest that MDGAs inhibit the activity of neuroligin-2 in controlling the function of inhibitory synapses and that MDGAs do so by binding to neuroligin-2.",2012,46,92,6,0,4,9,14,13,19,10,8,7,7

Born in Hungary in 1908, Teller witnessed the rise of Nazism and anti-Semitism, two world wars, the McCarthy era, and the changing face of big science. A brilliant and controversial figure whose work on nuclear weapons was key to the American war effort, Teller has long believed in freedom through strong defense, a philosophy reflected in his stance on arms control and nuclear policy. These extraordinary recollections at last reveal the man behind the headlines-passionate and humorous, devoted and loyal. In clear and compelling prose, Teller tells of the people, events, and ideas that shaped him as a scientist, beginning with his early love of music and math, and continuing with his study of quantum physics with Werner Heisenberg. Present at many of the pivotal moments in modern science, Teller also describes his friendships with some of the century's greatest minds-Einstein, Bohr, Fermi, Szilard, von Neumann, Oppenheimer-and offers an honest account of the development of the atomic and hydrogen bombs. He also offers a moving portrait of his childhood, his marriage and family life, and his friendship with physicist Maria Mayer.

667c15768f17261eecad46966a01ad08c71cd187,"Benzene under high pressure: a story of molecular crystals transforming to saturated networks, with a possible intermediate metallic phase.","In a theoretical study, benzene is compressed up to 300 GPa. The transformations found between molecular phases generally match the experimental findings in the moderate pressure regime (<20 GPa): phase I (Pbca) is found to be stable up to 4 GPa, while phase II (P4(3)2(1)2) is preferred in a narrow pressure range of 4-7 GPa. Phase III (P2(1)/c) is at lowest enthalpy at higher pressures. Above 50 GPa, phase V (P2(1) at 0 GPa; P2(1)/c at high pressure) comes into play, slightly more stable than phase III in the range of 50-80 GP, but unstable to rearrangement to a saturated, four-coordinate (at C), one-dimensional polymer. Actually, throughout the entire pressure range, crystals of graphane possess lower enthalpy than molecular benzene structures; a simple thermochemical argument is given for why this is so. In several of the benzene phases there nevertheless are substantial barriers to rearranging the molecules to a saturated polymer, especially at low temperatures. Even at room temperature these barriers should allow one to study the effect of pressure on the metastable molecular phases. Molecular phase III (P2(1)/c) is one such; it remains metastable to higher pressures up to ∼200 GPa, at which point it too rearranges spontaneously to a saturated, tetracoordinate CH polymer. At 300 K the isomerization transition occurs at a lower pressure. Nevertheless, there may be a narrow region of pressure, between P = 180 and 200 GPa, where one could find a metallic, molecular benzene state. We explore several lower dimensional models for such a metallic benzene. We also probe the possible first steps in a localized, nucleated benzene polymerization by studying the dimerization of benzene molecules.

Competing hypotheses suggest roles for SNAREs in mediating the specificity of fusion, catalyzing fusion, or actually executing fusion. We generated knockout mice lacking synaptobrevin/VAMP 2, the vesicular SNARE protein responsible for synaptic vesicle fusion in forebrain synapses, to make use of the exquisite temporal resolution of electrophysiology in measuring fusion. In the absence of synaptobrevin 2, spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion and fusion induced by hypertonic sucrose were decreased ∼10-fold, but fast Ca2+-triggered fusion was decreased more than 100-fold. Thus, synaptobrevin 2 may function in catalyzing fusion reactions and stabilizing fusion intermediates but is not absolutely required for synaptic fusion.",2001,0,609,34,2,24,32,25,24,39,34,33,38,31

They provide a homogeneous series of anion coordination patterns with the same ligand. The small F−-ion is tetracoordinated, while Cl− and Br− are bound in an octahedron of H-bonds. The non-complementarity between these spherical anions and the ellipsoidal cavity of BT-6H+ is reflected in ligand distortions.

Some splotches and streaks vary on characteristic timescales ∼2 weeks; they have characteristic dimensions of kilometers to tens of kilometers. The loci of these features appear in some cases to correspond well to the ground-based albedo markings, and the integrated time variation of splotches and streaks is suggested to produce the classical “seasonal” and secular albedo changes on Mars. The morphology and variability of streaks and splotches, and the resolution of at least one splotch into an extensive dune system, implicates windblown dust as the principal agent of Martian albedo differences and variability.",1972,26,151,1,2,8,9,8,13,5,3,6,1,6

Typically, these constraints prevent trial structures from falling into local minima. Nevertheless, P1 structures appear to migrate to false minima with significant frequency. These false minima are characterized by the presence of a large 'uranium' peak on the corresponding Fourier map. Fortunately, they can be recognized and avoided by considering the values of the minimal function both before and after the application of constraints. However, it appears that finding solutions for large P1 structures is likely also to require parameter-shift conditions different from those that have been found to work well in other space groups. In fact, these conditions often yield an unusually high percentage of solutions.",2000,9,8,0,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1
1c7c3d778cd8d480a24fac388700284644ae592c,Remarks on giant conductivity in TTF-TCNQ,We comment on some features of the recently observed giant conductivity in TTF-TCNQ that are independent of any particular mechanism. We point out that a mean field T c of several hundred degrees is required to explain the magnitude and suggest a formula based on an activation process that fits these data as well as a ( T − T c ) −3/2 law.,1973,7,74,1,1,7,2,7,1,0,1,0,0,0
